DIRECTORY: ./data2arl			
___________________________________________________________________

This directory contains various directories with example programs to 
convert meteorological data in various formats to the format (ARL 
packed) that Hysplit can read. The use of the packing routines is 
described in the User's Guide.  Routines may require some customiztion
depending upon the structure of the input data files.  

Briefly a ARL packed data file consists of a series of fixed length 
records, one for each meteorological variable. The records are 
arranged in time series, with surface fields followed by upper air
fields.  Each record contains a 50 byte ascii header that provides
information about the date, time, variable, and packing constants.
This is followed by the packed binary data, one byte per grid point.
Each byte represents the difference in value between that point and
the previous grid point. A group of records at the same time is 
preceeded by an index record that describes all the variables, levels,
and grid information for that time period.

The programs in this directory tend to be self contained or rely
upon the installation of other packages such as NetCDF. Originally, 
other conversion programs, that rely upon the subroutines in the 
hysplit library, were in the source directory, however these have been 
moved to the legacy subdirectory, including the sample program 
dat2arl.f.
