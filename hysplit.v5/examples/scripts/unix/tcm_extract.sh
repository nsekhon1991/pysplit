# Each dispersion factor file is now multiplied by the emission rate

# USAGE: condecay -{Cnumb:Index:HalfL:Radio}
# for example -{1:3:8.04:Igas} maps I-131g (column=1) with Dgas (Index=3)

# The program condecay -{Cnumb:Index:HalfL:Radio} multiplies
# the unit source factors in each TG file by the emissions
# defined in file "cfactors.txt" according to the release date.
# The mapping is defined on the command line: condecay -1:3:8.04:Igas -2:2:8.04:Ipar -3:2:11000.0:Cpar
# where in this case the first argument (-1:3:8.04:Igas) multiplies
# the first column in the emission file (I-131g gaseous Iodine) by
# the 3rd variable (Dgas) in the dispersion factor file, using a 
# half-life of 8.04 days and assigning the 4-character variable ID
# as Igas. The output from condecay is written to a file named: DG_{release date}
