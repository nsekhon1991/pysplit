rem    Output grid levels may be defined in any order for the puff

rem    must have a non-zero height defined. A height for the puff
rem    model indicates the concentration at that level. A height for

rem 44- Number of pollutants depositing
rem     Deposition parameters must be defined for each pollutant species
rem     emitted. Each species may behave differently for deposition
rem     calculations. Each will be tracked on its own concentration
rem     grid. The following five lines are repeated for each pollutant
rem     defined. Currently the number here must be identical to the
rem     number on line 10. Deposition is turned off for pollutants by
rem     an entry of zero in all fields.

rem    These three entries are used to compute gravitational

rem    be defined for particle deposition calculations. These values
rem    need to be correct only if gravitational settling is to be
rem    computed by the model, otherwise a nominal value of one may be
rem    assigned as a default for each entry, and a dry deposition
rem    velocity should be specified in the next line. If wet removal
rem    is required for particles, then any non-zero value in all fields
rem    will define a particle for wet deposition calculations.

rem        Effective Henry's Constant
rem
rem        Dry deposition calculations are performed at the lowest
rem        model level based upon the relation that the deposition
rem        flux equals the velocity times the ground-level air
rem        concentration. This calculation is available for gases
rem        and particles. However specification of a non-zero dry
rem        deposition velocity will take precedence over gravitational
rem        settling or the computation of a dry deposition velocity
rem        based upon land-use which requires setting the remaining
rem        four parameters (molecular weight, surface reactivity,
rem        diffusivity, and effective Henry's constant). The
rem        calculation of the dry deposition velocity uses the
rem        resistance method. See the discussion about dry deposition
rem        in the model equations reference before setting these values.
rem        The most simple option is to define a default value for the
rem        deposition velocity. Although this value over-rides the
rem        gravitational settling computed from the definition of a
rem        particle on line 27, non-zero values on line 27 are the
rem        only way to define a particle for wet removal calculations.

rem 47(3)- Wet Removal: Henry's (Molar/atm),
rem                     In-cloud (L/L), Below-cloud (1/s)
rem        Henry's constant defines the wet removal process for
rem        soluble gases. It is defined only as a first-order process
rem        by a non-zero value in the field. Wet removal of particles
rem        is defined by non-zero values for the in-cloud and below-cloud
rem        parameters. In-cloud removal is defined as a ratio of pollutant
rem        in cloud-water to that in rain. Below-cloud removal is defined
rem        through a removal time constant. One or both processes may be
rem        defined for particles.
rem
rem              NOTE: I think that the in-cloud parameter is really the 
rem              ratio of pollutant in the overall cloud (grams/liter of cloud)
rem              to that in rain (grams/liter of rain). In HYSPLIT_3, I had

rem              of cloud divided by grams of pollutant per gram of rain),
rem              and the value of 3.2x10^5 changed to 400 in these units.
rem
rem              Subsequently, I changed the washout ratio from 400 to 50,
rem              in an attempt to better match measurement data for dioxin.
