<p><h2>Concentration / Display / Grid Values </h2></p>

<p>A generic Postscript equivalent of the Windows-only concentration 
grid point data display program is available through this menu. 
This particular program (<i>gridplot</i>) was designed to plot global
sized concentration grids, although any sized grid may be displayed.
Concentration values over the entire grid (or a zoomed area) will be 
shown using a color-fill in each grid cell according to its
concentration value. The options available through the GUI are setting
the input file, output file, lowest contour value, contour interval, 
species number, linear or logarithmic scaling, and the longitude offset,
the center latitude, the zoom factor, the concentration multiplier,
and the choice of GIS output. By default, each time period is output 
to a different file name, gridplot_{???}.ps, where the sequence number 
{???} is incremented by one for each time period. When called from the 
<i>Global Grid</i> menu tab, the default output file name is gemplot 
rather than gridplot.</p>

<p>Several other options are available through the command line, which
may be needed if multiple levels have been written to the concentration
output file. <b>USAGE: gridplot -[options(default)]</b></p> 

<ul>
-i[input file name (cdump.bin)]<br>
-p[Process output file name suffix]<br>
-o[output name (plot.ps)]<br>
-l[lowest interval value (1.0E-36), -1 = use data minimum]<br>
-m[multi frames one file (0=no) 1=yes]<br>
-c[concentration multiplier (1.0)]<br>
-d[delta interval value (1000.0)]<br>
-s[species number to display: (1); 0-sum]<br>
-h[height of level to display (m) (integer): (0 = dep)]<br>
-j[Graphics map background file name: (arlmap)]<br>
-a[scale: 0-linear, (1)-logarithmic]<br>
-x[longitude offset (0), e.g., o--90: U.S. center; o-90: China center]<br>
-y[latitude center (0), e.g., 40.0: U.S. center]<br>
-f[(0), 1-ascii text output files for mapped values]<br>
-g[GIS: 0-none 1-GENERATE(log10) 2-GENERATE(value) 3-KML 4-partial KML]<br>
-k[KML options: 0-none 1-KML with no extra overlays]<br>
-u[mass units(ie, kg, mg, etc); note these are labels only]<br>
-z[zoom: (0)-no zoom, 99-most zoom]<br>
</ul>

<p>When called from the <i>Global Grid</i> menu tab, an additional feature is
available through the <i>Add Plume</i> checkbox. In this case, the first
plume model concentration grid (if more than one is defined) is added to the
global model concentration grid as defined in this menu. The merged
concentration file is called <i>concadd.bin</i> which is then displayed
by <i>gridplot</i>. The two concentration files that are added must be
identical in terms of the number levels and pollutants. However, the spatial grid
characteristics may be different. The height of the levels at each index do not
have to be identical. If this issue is important, then the heights heights
corresponding to the global model heights needs to be set in the CONTROL file
setup menu. Note that the global model vertical heights cannot be changed by the
user and correspond with the heights of the meteorological data levels. The
horizontal characteristics of the output grid always takes the grid
dimensions of the second grid (-b).</p>

<b>USAGE: concadd -[options(default)]</b>

<ul>
    -i[input file name (cdump)]<br>
    -b[base file name to which input is added (gdump)]<br>
    -o[output file name with base format (concadd.bin)]<br>
    -g[radius (grid points around center) to exclude; default=0]<br>
    -c[concentration conversion factor (1.0)]<br>
    -p[sum process (0)=add | 1=max value | 2=zero mask | 3=intersect]<br>
                                         | 4=replace]<br>
    -z[zero mask value (base set to zero when input>mask; default=0.0)]<br>
                       if zero mask value < 0 :<br>
                            base set to zero when input> zero mask value * base<br>
</ul>
