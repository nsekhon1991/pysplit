<p><h2>Concentration / Special Runs / Daily</h2></p>

<p>This special menu is used to execute multiple automated concentration
simulations for days, weeks, or months. The script will start the first 
simulation at the time set in the CONTROL file and then generate
new simulations based upon the values shown in the menu. In the example
shown below, the simulation starts at 95 10 16 00. Each simulation has
a duration of 12 hours (only shown in the SETUP menu). A new simulation
will be started every 6 hours until one day after the start time. The model
output files are named according to the base name set in the control file 
but are appended either with a six digit month, day and hour field or a
sequential number. This approach differs from a single simulation with
multiple starting times in that each simulation is independent and a new
output file is created for each run.</p>

<p>The model should be configured and run for the first simulation time
through the standard run menu to insure that the simulation is configured
correctly. If part of the simulation requires meteorological data from the
previous month or the next month, these should be included in the base
simulation test.</p>

<p>After pressing the <i>Execute Script</i> the start of each simulation is
noted in the log until the script completes. Note that concentration simulations
are much slower than trajectories and it may take a while before the log is
updated. In this example, four simulations were completed.</p>

<p>A variation of the basic simulation that reduces the run duration by the
new run increment time is configured when the <i>Shorten each new run duration</i>
checkbutton is enabled. This procedure is the first step in creating the dispersion
files needed to generate a Transfer Coefficient Matrix. See the help sections
on <a href="S337.htm">SVD</a> and <a href="S437.htm">Cost Function</a> solutions
of the TCM. In the example shown, setting the run reduction duration checkbutton
results in only two completed simulations. The first one has a duration of 12 hours
while the second one is 6 hours. The subsequent simulation would have a duration
of zero hours. The concept behind the run duration reduction is that the output
from all dispersion simulations should have the same end time. In the example
shown here, the initial run duration should have been 24 hours, not 12, and then
all four simulation would have completed and the last simulation, the one starting
at 18 UTC would have had a duration of 6 hours and ended at 00 UTC the next day.
This issue must be corrected in the SETUP menu where the base run duration needs
to be changed from 12 to 24 hours.</p>
