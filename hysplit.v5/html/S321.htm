<p><h2>Concentration / Display / Ensemble / Create Files</h2></p>

<p>Multiple concentration output files from the ensemble or variance
dispersion simulation can be processed to produce probability displays.
This file creation step is required to create the files that are needed
by the <i>Ensemble / Display / View Map</i> and <i> Box Plot</i> tabs.</p>

<p>The <i>Create Files</i> menu calls a special program <i>conprob</i>
that reads all the existing concentration files with a three-digit
suffix (001 to 999) and generates various probability files. The <i>Create 
Files</i> menu can be used to convert multiple concentration output files 
to probability form, regardless of how they were generated. It is not 
necessary to use the pre-configured <a href="S356.htm#run_ensemble">
ensemble version</a> of the model to create the ensemble members. Any number 
of multiple simulations can be used as long as the file suffixes end with a
numeric three-digit sequence. Menu settings for the output file name should
reflect the base name without the numeric suffix. An illustration of the 
<i>Ensemble Create Files</i> menu is shown below.</p>

<p>The creation of probability files is limited to one pollutant species 
and/or one concentration level. If the input files contain more than one of 
either, the index number of the desired species and level should be entered.
The <i>Aggregation</i> number defaults to one, which means that only the ensemble
members for one time period are aggregated together to produce the probability
display. Hence there would be an independent probability map for each time 
period. However, multiple time periods may be combined to produce a single
probability plot. The <i>Aggregation</i> entry represents the number of time 
periods, not the actual time span. For instance, if the model output is set to 
produce a one-hour average and the model is run for 24 hours, then each ensemble 
member will have 24 time periods of output. By default the probability output will
represent the ensemble member variation for each hour, that is 24 frames of
output will be produced. However if the aggregation period is set to 24, then
all output times will be combined into one output frame and the ensemble 
result will represent the hourly variations as well as the member variations.</p>

<p>The last entry is optional and it represents the maximum concentration at which
the probability to exceed certain concentration values are calculated. Leaving the
field equal to zero causes the program to use the order-of-magnitude value just
below the maximum concentration value of any member. If a value is set, then the
program computes the probabilities to exceed the set maximum, and the probabilities
at 10% and 1% of that value.</p>

<p>The <i>Create Files</i> button runs the <i>conprob</i> extraction program, which 
will always produce all the probability variations, one to each output file, for a 
given aggregation period, in the working directory. The <i>conprob</i> output
files contain the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>cnumb - Number of members with concentrations greater than zero
<li>cmean - Concentration mean of all members
<li>cvarn - Concentration variance of all members
<li>ccoev - Coefficient of variation (sqrt(variance)*100/mean)
<li>cmax01 - Probability of 1% of the concentration maximum
<li>cmax10 - Probability at 10% of the concentration maximum
<li>cmax00 - Probability at the maximum concentration level
<li>prob05 - Concentrations at the 05<sup>th</sup> percentile
<li>prob10 - Concentrations at the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile
<li>prob25 - Concentrations at the 25<sup>th</sup> percentile
<li>prob50 - Concentrations at the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile
<li>prob75 - Concentrations at the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile
<li>prob90 - Concentrations at the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile
<li>prob95 - Concentrations at the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile
</ul>

<p>The command line options for the probability program <b>conprob [-options]</b> 
are as follows:</p>
<ul>
-b[base] input file name (cdump)<br>
-c[concentration maximum] (0=auto | conc_high:conc_mid:conc_low)<br>
-d[diagnostics = true]<br>
-p[pollutant] index number for multi-pollutant files (1)<br>
-t[temporal] aggregation period (1)<br>
-v[value] of concentration below which is assumed to equal zero (0.0)<br>
-z[level] index number for multi-level files (1)<br>
</ul>
