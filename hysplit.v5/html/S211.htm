<p><h2>Trajectory / Saving and Retrieving</h2></p>

<p>The <a href="S210.htm">trajectory</a> and <a href="S310.htm">concentration</a>
setup menus for the <i>CONTROL</i> file permit a <i>Save As</i> or <i>Retrieve</i>
option. Each of these menus is shown in the panel below. After a simulation has
been configured, run, displayed, and assuming that the results are satisfactory
and no more changes are required, then go back to the setup menu tab and <i>Save As</i>
the control file by giving it a unique name, such as <i>newname_traj</i> in the
example below. There are no restrictions on the naming convention. If the simulation
is to be rerun, perhaps with some minor variation, the <i>Retrieve</i> option is used
to load those values back into the setup menu.</p>
