<p><h2>Meteorology / Display Data / Check File</h2></p>

<p>The program called through this menu is used to show the
details of the meteorological data file contained in the index
record as well as a listing of the header portion (first 50 bytes)
of each data record. The output is written to a text file
called chkfile.txt. More detailed information about the structure
of a meteorological data file is <a href="S141.htm">available</a>.
The check file program uses the same library routines as HYSPLIT.
Therefore if this program does not work with the meteorological
data file, neither will HYSPLIT.</p>
