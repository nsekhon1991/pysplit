<p><h2>Advanced / Configuration Setup / Concentration Packing and Output Units</h2></p>

<p><b>Concentration Packing Method</b></p>

<p><i>CPACK</i> is the flag to turn off (set to 0) concentration output packing.
The default is to write the binary concentration file at only those grid points
that have a non-zero concentration value (set to 1). Setting the flag to zero
results in the output of the entire concentration grid. Due to the nature of the
packing method, if the plume covers more than 50% of the concentration grid, the
default concentration packing will result in larger output file than an unpacked
concentration file. After selecting a new packing value, use the <i>Update</i> 
button to change its value for the selected grid. The default menu is shown below.</p>

<p>The <i>Point</i> option (<i>CPACK=2</i>) is a special feature that forces the
concentration grid to have a size of one grid point over the location of the center
point. It is a way to define a single sampling location.</p> 

<p>In the case where <i>CPACK=3</i> defines a polar concentration grid defined by
radial sectors centered about the origin latitude-longitude position. In this case
the grid spacing and span defined in the <a href="S313.htm">CONTROL</a> file define
the arc sector size (latitude values) and the sector distances (longitude values).
Polar concentration grids may be displayed using the program  
<a href="Image116.gif" target="_new"><i>poleplot</i></a>. Note that because of
way a particle's position on the grid is computed, it is not possible to define
a polar concentration grid spanning the dateline.</p>

<p>If there is more than once concentration grid, the selected packing method will
be applied to all concentration grids. However, unlike any of the other namelist
variables, <i>CPACK</i> is dimensioned so that a different value can be set for
each grid. For instance, in the example shown below, the model was configured with
two concentration grids, the first with no packing, and the second grid defined
as a polar grid. If more than two concentration grids exist, but <i>CPACK</i> was
defined for only the first two grids, as in this example, all subsequent grids
would be defined as rectangular grids and use the default packing method
<i>CPACK=1</i>. Commas should terminate each <i>CPACK</i> value.</p>

<p><b>Concentration or Mass Output Units</b></p>

<p>The default option (<i>CMASS=0</i>) is to output units of mass/volume. However,
if mass-only output is desired, then setting <i>CMASS=1</i> will cause the model
not to divide the grid cell sum by its volume.</p>
