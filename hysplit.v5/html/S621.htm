<p><h2>Advanced / Configuration Setup / Sub-grid Size and Vertical Coordinate</h2></p>

<p><h3>Meteorological Sub-grid Size</h3></p>

<p>MGMIN (10) is the minimum size in grid units of the meteorological
sub-grid. The sub-grid is set dynamically during the calculation and
depends upon the horizontal distribution of end-points and the wind
speed. Larger sub-grids than necessary will slow down the calculation
by forcing the processing of meteorological data in regions where no
transport or dispersion calculations are being performed. In some
situations, such as when the computation is between meteorological
data files that have no temporal overlap or insufficient spatial overlap,
the model may try to reload meteorological data with a new sub-grid. This
will result in a fatal error. One solution to this error would be to 
increase the minimum grid size larger than the meteorological grid to
force a full-grid data load.</p>

<p><h3>Vertical Grid Coordinate System</h3></p>

<p>KMSL (0) sets the default for input heights to be relative to the terrain
height of the meteorological model. Hence input heights are specified as AGL.
Setting this parameter to "1" forces the model to subtract the local terrain
height from source input heights before further processing. Hence input heights
should be specified as relative to Mean Sea Level (MSL). In concentration
simulations, the MSL option also forces the vertical concentration grid heights
to be considered relative to mean sea level. The option to set the release
height dynamically as a fraction of the mixed layer depth is not available
for concentration-dispersion simulations.</p>
