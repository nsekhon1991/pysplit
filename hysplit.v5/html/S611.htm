<p><h2>Advanced / Configuration Setup / Define subgrid and MSL/AGL units</h2></p>

<p><h3>Meteorological Sub-grid Size</h3></p>

<p><i>MGMIN</i> (10) - is the minimum size in grid units of the
meteorological sub-grid. The sub-grid is set dynamically during the
calculation and depends upon the horizontal distribution of
end-points and the wind speed. Larger sub-grids than necessary will
slow down the calculation by forcing the processing of
meteorological data in regions where no transport or dispersion
calculations are being performed. In some situations, such as when
the computation is between meteorological data files that have no
temporal overlap or insufficient spatial overlap, the model may try
to reload meteorological data with a new sub-grid. This will result
in a fatal error. One solution to this error would be to increase the
minimum grid size larger than the meteorological grid to force a 
full-grid data load.</p>
  
<p><h3>Height Unit for Input</h3></p>

<p><i>KMSL</i> (0) - sets the default for input heights to be relative
to the terrain height of the meteorological model. Hence input
heights are specified as AGL. Setting this parameter to "1" forces
the model to subtract the local terrain height from source input
heights before further processing. Hence input heights should be
specified as relative to Mean Sea Level (MSL). In concentration
simulations, the MSL option also forces the vertical concentration
grid heights to be considered relative to mean sea level. The
special option (xBL) sets KMSL to 2 and treats the input height as
a fraction of the boundary layer (or mixed layer) depth at the
trajectory starting location and time. This option is not valid
with any multiple trajectory in time configurations or any of the
concentration-dispersion calculations. Valid starting heights can
be defined as any non-zero fraction less than 2.0.</p>

<p><h3>Height Unit for Output</h3></p>

<p>The namelist variable KAGL (=1) only applies to trajectories, not 
concentration simulations. For trajectory simulations, the default option
is to write the heights as AGL (KAGL=1), setting KAGL=0 converts the trajectory
output heights to MSL. The KMSL namelist parameter described above only applies
to how heights are interpreted in the CONTROL file, while KAGL determines how
the model heights are written to the output file. This <a href="S640.htm">variable</a>
is not available through the GUI.</p>
