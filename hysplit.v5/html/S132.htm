<p><h2>Meteorology / Display Data / Text Profile</h2></p>

<p>The profile program is used to create a profile at a specific
location of the meteorological variables in an ARL format packed
data file. Output is written to the ASCII text file
<i>profile.txt</i>. Note that the program does not interpolate to
the selected point, but processes the data at the grid point
nearest to the location selected. In the example shown below the
sample meteorological data file has been selected to display the
profile at 40N 90W. The time period to be shown is offset 24 hours
from the first time period in the file. No additional time periods
are shown when the increment is set to zero.</p>

<p>The output is written to a file called <i>profile.txt</i> and
the following would be shown in the GUI's display window. The U
&amp; V wind components shown on the left side are relative to the
grid, while those on the right side are with respect to north-south
and east-west. They would be the same for a latitude-longitude
grid.</p>
