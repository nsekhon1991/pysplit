<p><h2>Concentration / Special Runs  / Daughter products</h2></p>




<p>Setting up this run consists in the following steps.<p>
Step 1: Define the nuclide parent name (e.g. Cs-137) and run a preprocessor
(nuctree) that creates a summary text file (DAUGHTER.TXT) that contains
the daughter nuclides produced by a parent nuclide along with the half-life 
and branching fractions. This file is required to be in the working 
directory when running HYSPLIT for this application.
In addition, the preprocessor will read the CONTROL file and create a new
(CONTROL.DAUGHTER) file containing the daughter information. The names
of the species will be given in numbers that correspond to the daughter
products names written in the DAUGHTER.TXT file.
Finaly, the GUI will copy the CONTROL.DAUGHTER back to CONTROL. </p>
<p>Step 2: configure setup (SETUP.CFG) indicating that the daughter products module will 
be used (ICHEM=11) and set Maxdim=#daughters obtained from DAUGHTER.TXT<p>
