<p><h2>Meteorology / Convert to ARL / MM5V3 format</h2></p>

<p>This menu tab is intended to convert MM5 Version 3 output
files, usually named MMOUT_DOMAIN{X}, to the ARL packed <a href=
"S141.htm">HYSPLIT compatible</a> format. Input files can have any
name. The reformatted output files are named by default to
DATA{X}.ARL, where "X" is the domain number. The output file can be
renamed through the menu. Multiple time periods can be contained in
one file. Note that the conversion program rounds the output times
to the nearest 15 minutes. This is required because when MM5 is run
on a multiprocessor system, output times may differ be a few
minutes for each output cycle.</p>
