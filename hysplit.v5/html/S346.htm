<p><h2>Concentration / Utilities / Particle Adjustment</h2></p>

<p>This menu calls a utility program that can be used to adjust the particle positions
prior to restarting the simulation from a saved particle position file. The particle
position file needs to be written by setting the appropriate namelist parameter as
described in the Advanced/Configuration Setup/Concentration <a href="S627.htm">menu tab</a>.
Normally observational data should be consulted prior to making any adjustments to the
particle positions. Positions are only shifted horizontally and not vertically. The same
horizontal adjustment is applied at all heights. If a height adjustment is required, the
model should be re-run with a different initial particle height distribution.</p>

<p>One or more particle files may be processed by a single execution. A standard simulation
only generates one particle output file containing positions at one or more time periods.
Multiple particle position files, with a three-digit suffix (.001, .002, etc), are 
automatically generated by the <a href="S356.htm">ensemble</a> version of the model. The
adjusted output is always written to a new file name, defaulting to <i>PARINIT</i>, also
the default name for initializing a new simulation.</p>

<p>Regardless of how many time periods are contained in the particle position file,
the adjustment is only applied to one time period, normally the initialization time period
for the next simulation. If the time field (-t) is not specified, then the adjustment occurs
to the first time period in the file, otherwise the adjustment is applied to the MMDDHH
designated in the time argument. Only this one time period is written to the output file,
regardless of how many time periods are contained within the input file.</p>

<p>A particle position shift can be specified as an angular adjustment in degrees and distance
from a fixed location (such as the particle source point). A shift may also be specified as
a window translation, where all particles within a given latitude-longitude window are shifted
by a specified number of degrees in latitude and longitude. No particles outside of the window
or beyond the radius are shifted unless the blending (-b) flag is set. In this case, the shift
is applied to each particle in a linearly decreasing fashion to zero adjustment at a distance
of two windows.</p> 

<p>The spatial adjustment of the particle positions in the HYSPLIT binary particle output file
are specified on the command line (or through the GUI) as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li> USAGE: parshift -[options (default)]</li>
<li> -b[blend shifting outside of the window or distance range]</li>
<li> -i[input base file name particle positions (PARDUMP)]</li>
<li> -o[output base file name of adjusted particles (PARINIT)]</li>
<li> -r[rotation shift (degrees:kilometers:latitude:longitude)]</li>
<li> -s[search for multiple input files with .000 suffix attached to base name]</li>
<li> -t[time MMDDHH (missing field then process first time only)]</li>
<li> -w[window translation corners lat1:lon1:lat2:lon2 (-90.0:-180.0:90.0:180.0)]</li>
<li> -x[delta longitude for window translation (0.0)]</li>
<li> -y[delta latitude for window translation (0.0)]</li>
</ul>

<p>The particle position file may be converted to a binary concentration file through the
command line utility program <a href="S350.htm">par2conc</a>.</p>
