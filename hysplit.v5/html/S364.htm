<p><h2>Concentration / Display Data / Terrain Overlay</h2></p>

<p>The use of several menu features is demonstrated here that will permit
the creation of a map of the concentration plume with political boundaries
and contours of the terrain as defined by the meteorological data. The
basic process is to create a shapefile of the terrain and add that file
to a shapefile of the political boundaries. Although this demonstration is
for terrain and concentration any line or contour based shapefile can be
displayed through the concentration or trajectory plotting programs.</p>

<p>Open the Meteorology / Display Data / <a href="S131.htm">Contour Map</a>
menu and select the meteorological data file, the station height field 
(SHGT=terrain), and set the GIS checkbox, which will output the terrain field 
in generate format. It might be necessary to force the contours and the center 
of the map to get a nice looking display over the region of interest. In this 
case for the west coast of the U.S. the maximum terrain height was set to 
2500 m with an interval of 250 meters between contours.</p>

<p>Run the contour program and the display shown below will be created.
In the <i>working</i> there will be an additional file called 
<i>GIS_METEO_01.txt</i> which is the generate format text file of the 
terrain contours.</p>

<p>Now open the GIS to Shapefile <a href="S135.htm">utility menu</a> and 
browse for the generate format file name. Select the "Polygons" radiobutton 
to insure that the terrain polygons are treated as closed connected lines. 
After processing the input file, four output files will be created with the 
base name of contour. The subsequent plotting programs only need the 
<i>contour.shp</i> file, but the other files may be needed for import into 
other GIS applications.</p>

<p>If you do not have a plume simulation already completed, open the 
concentration setup menu and run the default test case, but move the 
starting location to 40N 125W and run the model for 24 rather than 12 hours.
To simplify the output, set the concentration grid averaging time to 24 h
and reduce the grid resolution from 0.05 to 0.10. Then run the model.</p>

<p>After the run completes, go to the <i>hysplit/graphics</i>
directory and copy <i>arlmap.shp</i> and <i>shapefiles_arl.txt</i> to the 
working directory.  Rename <i>shapefiles_arl.txt</i> to <i>shapefiles.txt</i>. 
Then open notepad in working to edit 
<a href="S230.htm#shp_map"><i>shapefiles.txt</i></a> to add the additional 
file (line) defining the shapefile with the terrain. For this display, the 
line is twice as thick as the map background and the color is defined as 
black (0.0 0.0 0.0).</p>

<center><p><img src="Image106.gif" width="335" height="118"></p></center>

<p>Now open the concentration / display / contours menu and define the
<i>shapefiles.txt</i> in the field for the map background. This will 
cause the display program to use the files defined in this file rather
than the default map background. Multiple shapefiles can be displayed
at the same time.</P>

<p>Executing the display will result in the following image showing the
intersection of the plume with the elevated terrain as it moves to the
east.</p>
