<p><h2>Concentration / Utilities / Convert to DATEM</h2></p>

<p>This menu calls a utility program to convert the HYSPLIT binary concentration
file to the <a href="S500.htm">DATEM</a> data format
and compares the model predicted results with the actual measured data.
The Data Archive of Tracer Experiments and Meteorology 
(<a href="http://www.arl.noaa.gov/DATEM.php">DATEM)</a> web page contains
additional details about each of the experiments, the data formats, and more
complete descriptions of each of the programs used to convert the data and 
generate the statistical results. The on-line repository has links to several
different tracer experiments and their associated meterological data. All
experimental data have been converted to a common format. The meteorological
data are compatible for direct use by HYSPLIT.</p>

<p>To facilitate application of the analysis software, all the experimental data
from the second CAPTEX release are provide in the ./hysplit/datem directory. 
Included are the control, namelist, measured data, and meteorological data files.
The meteorological data is taken from the North American Regional Reanalysis.
The computational sequence is as follows:<p>

1) Configure and Run HYSPLIT
<ul>
<li> Go to the concentration setup run menu and retrieve ./datem/captex.cnt
<li> Go to the advanced configuaration concentration menu and retrieve ./datem/captex2.cfg
<li> Save and then Run Model
</ul>

2) Convert HYSPLIT run results to DATEM format
<ul>
<li> Browse to load the measured data file ./datem/captex2.txt
<li> Create the DATEM file hysplit.txt from the binary file hysplit2.bin
<li> Compute the Statistics and view the Scatter Plot
</ul>

<p>In the first section of the menu, a measured data file already in DATEM format
should be selected. The input data file represents the HYSPLIT binary concentration
output file which is then converted to a DATEM formatted text file using the units
conversion factor. The conversion program will match each measurement with a
model calculated concentration corresponding to the location and time duration of
the measurement. Note that the model temporal output frequency needs to be the same
or of finer resolution than the measurement periods, otherwise calculations cannot
be matched with the measurements.</p>

<p>The rotation angle entry field (default = 0.0) can be used to test the
sensitivity of the model prediction to small changes in wind direction. Setting
a non-zero angle will result in the rotation of the calculated plume with
respect to the sampling network in the direction specified. The rotation is
computed using the first source location specified in the setup menu. The 
effect of this test is comparable to rotating the transport wind direction by
the same amount. However, this sensitivity test only makes sense in the context
of plumes that have a relatively homogeneous and stationary structure.</p>

<p>Once the model output file in DATEM format has been created, the statistical
evaluation program should be run to compare the model calculations with
the measurements in terms of various performance statistics. Two data processing
options are available. For verification statistics, all values can be compared, 
only plume values (both measured and calculated values are greater than zero), or 
all values but excluding pairs where both measured and calculated values are zero.
In terms of averaging, the measured and calculated values can be used directly,
temporally averaged resulting in one value for each location, or spatially averaged
resulting in one value for each time period. The contingency level is the
concentration value required to be exceeded to compute the false alarm rate, 
probability of detection, and threat-score. The contingency level is also used as
the plotting threshold for the measured-calculated scatter diagram which is created
by the <i>Scatter Plot</i> menu button.</p>

<p> Note that simulations with multiple species and levels are not supported. The 
concentration data files follow no specific naming convention and any input or output 
file name may be selected in the menu. Arbitrary input file names can only be set
through the <i>Setup / Grids</i> menu. The statistical output files are always written
to <i>stat{A|T|S}.txt</i> where the character A|T|S represents All data, Temporal
averaging, or Spatial averaging. An additional output file, <i>data{A|T|S}.txt</i> is
created for the scatter diagram plot, which is always named <i>scatter.ps</i>. The
<i>Rename output</i> field in the GUI adds those text characters between the above
prefix and suffix fields: <i>{stat|data}{A|T|S}_{rename}.txt</i></p>
