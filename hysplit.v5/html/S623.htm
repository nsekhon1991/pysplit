<p><h2>Advanced / Configuration Setup / Particle-Puff Release Number Limits</h2></p>

<p>The number of particles released per cycle <i>NUMPAR (2500)</i> would be
the maximum number of particles or puffs released over the duration of the
emission. <i>NUMPAR</i> has a different meaning for puff and particle
simulations. In a full puff simulation (<i>INITD</i> = 1 or 2), only one
puff per time step is released, regardless of the value of <i>NUMPAR</i>.
In a particle or mixed particle-puff simulation (<i>INITD</i> = 0, 3, 4),
<i>NUMPAR</i> represents the total number of particles that are released
during one release cycle. Multiple release cycles cannot produce more than
<i>MAXPAR</i> number of particles. For a mixed simulation (particle-puff),
<i>NUMPAR</i> should be greater than one but does not need to be anything
close to what is required for a full 3D particle simulation.</p>

<p>To simplify certain simulations when a constant particle number release rate
is required, specifying a negative value for <i>NUMPAR</i> will over-ride the
particle number release rate calculations (in terms of the number of sources, 
hours emission, and pollutants) and force the particle release rate to be 
<i>|NUMPAR|</i> particles per hour for each source and pollutant.</p>

<p>The maximum number of particles <i>MAXPAR (10000)</i> is the maximum number
permitted to be carried at any time during a simulation. In all simulation
types, particle or puffs are only emitted if the particle count is less than
<i>MAXPAR</i>. Note that there are situations where <i>NUMPAR</i> can (and
should) exceed <i>MAXPAR</i> because the actual particle release rate is
computed by dividing <i>NUMPAR</i> by the number of sources, pollutants,
and release hours.</p>

<p>The maximum particle duration <i>KHMAX (9999)</i> is the number of hours
after release that a particle is dropped from the simulation. For simulations using
regional meteorological grids, particles are dropped when the reach the grid
boundary. However, when using global meteorological data, it may be computationally
prudent to drop particles after they are no longer over the region of interest.</p>
