<p><h2>Advanced / File Edit / Emissions File</h2></p>

<p>This menu creates the optional EMITIMES file which is used to configure 
more complex point source emissions scenarios. In the standard model simulation,
the CONTROL file can only be used to define one pollutant release cycle which
applies equally to all source locations. Although multiple release cycles can
be defined, they must all be at the same interval.  Using the EMITIMES file to
define the point source emissions, multiple release locations can each have
their own emission characteristics, each with different pollutants, if desired.
Furthermore, multiple emission cycles, at non-regular intervals can also be
defined. By appropriately locating multiple sources in space and time, line-
source as well as other non-regular emissions configurations can be created.
In version 4.8 the format of this file has changed from previous HYSPLIT
versions to such an extent that they are incompatible with each other. In all
versions the file name is defined by the <i>EFILE</i> variable in the 
<a href="S624.htm">namelist</a> configuration file created thorough
the <i>Advanced / Configuration</i> menu tab.

<p>The first menu tab defaults to the configuration for one source. If 
multiple sources are required, then enter the number in this menu. After
pressing the <i>Configure Locations</i> button, another menu comes up to
select the location number to configure. Pressing the location number button
brings up the menu shown below. The GUI menu only supports the creation of
a file for one pollutant for one emission cycle.  If multiple pollutants are
defined, or multiple cycles are required, then the file must be edited manually
by duplicating the emission record at each location for all pollutants in the
order they are defined in the CONTROL file. Each defined release location must
be configured according to the following instructions. The point source
emissions file must be located in the startup directory the name should always
be in uppercase. The following is an example of the contents of EMITIMES file
for one location. Multiple locations would have one line per location. The
number of data records should equal the number of sources defined in the 
CONTROL file times the number of pollutants released.</p>

<p>The EMITIMES file may also be configured to construct a vertical line source by
having two consecutive emission points defined at the same spatial location but each
with different heights. Unlike the vertical line source definition through the
CONTROL file, where the same emission rate is defined for all sources, here the
emission rate may be varied through the column. For instance, if the source
record N is at the same location as record N-1, the the emission rate defined for
record N-1 will be used for all particles released in the column from N-1 to N.
This means that the emission value given for the last record, in a series of records
at the same location will not be used.</p>  

<ul>
<li>Record 1 - Identification record describing the emission cycle header record
<li>Record 2 - Identification record describing a location emission data record
<li>Record 3 - First emission cycle header record
<li>Record 4 - First emission data record in the first emission cycle
</ul>

<p><b>Emission Cycle Header Record: {YYYY} {MM} {DD} {HH} {hhhh} {#rec}</b></p>
<ul>
<li>{YYYY} {MM} {DD} {HH} - Starting time of the emission cycle, with each new
             emission cycle, all previous emission records are replaced with
             those in the new cycle.
<li>{hhhh} - Duration in hours that this emission cycle is valid.
<li>{#rec} - Number of emission records in this cycle (= # sources times # pollutants).
</ul>

<p><b>Emission Cycle Data Record: {YYYY} {MM} {DD} {HH} {mm} {HHmm} {Lat} {Lon} {Hgt} {Rate} {Area} {Heat}</b></p>

<ul>
<li>{YYYY} {MM} {DD} {HH} {mm} - Emission start time at this location
<li>{HHmm} - Release duration in hours and minutes (no space).
<li>{Lat} {Lon} {Hgt} - Position and height of the release.
<li>{Rate} - Emission rate in mass units per hour.
<li>{Area} - Emission area in square meters. Zero is treated as a point
             source.  
<li>{Heat} - Heat released during the emission or fire radiative power 
	     for <a href="S640.htm">namelist option PLRISE</a> = 1 or 2, 
	     respectively. Non-zero values result in a buoyancy plume rise
	     calculation, replacing the previous height value.
</ul>

<p>The emission cycle header record defines the valid time period for the subsequent data records.
At the end of the header record time period {hhhh}, the model will attempt to read the next emission
cycle header record. If no header record is found, then the EMITIMES emission processing is terminated
and the model reverts to using the emission values defined in the CONTROL file. For instance, this
means that if a short emission duration is defined in the data records, but the model simulation
covers a longer period, the header record duration {hhhh} should be long enough to cover the entire
simulation period. Unless it is intended to use both methods, the emission rate and duration in the
CONTROL file should both be set to zero when using an EMITIMES file.</p>

<p><b> Emission Area </b><p>
For computational particles <a href="S622.htm"> (INITD=0,103,104)</a> the emission area is a square by default. For version v5.1.0 and later,
the <a href="S640.htm"> AREA namelist option</a> may be used to specify a circular emission area for computational particles, 
AREA=1.
Particles are
distributed randomly with a uniform distribution in the emission area. For versions earlier than v5.1.0 the square area was smaller than the
specified area by a factor of 1/&pi;. 
<br>
For Gaussian puffs, the specified area is the area out to 1.54&sigma;. Hence, the whole puff will cover a larger area.
The standard deviation for the Gaussian puff is calculated from 
&sigma; = (A/&pi;)<sup>1/2</sup> / 1.54.  Where A is the specified area in square meters. 
<br>

<p><b>Special Case: Backward simulations</b></p>

<p>In the case of backward simulations, the cycle header record should point to the first (oldest)
emission cycle and all subsequent emission cycles should be earlier in time. The emission start time
within a cycle corresponds to a time such that the duration of emissions proceeds backward from that
starting time. The internal backward flag has already been set from the negative run duration in the 
CONTROL file and therefore all time durations in the EMITIMES file should be expressed as positive numbers.
