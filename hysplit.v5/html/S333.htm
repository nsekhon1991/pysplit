<p><h2>Concentration / Display / Ensemble / Box Plot</h2></p>

<p>Multiple concentration output files from the ensemble or variance
dispersion simulation can be processed to produce probability displays.
The <i>Ensemble / Create Files</i> menu calls a special program <i>conprob</i>
that reads the concentration files with the ensemble member three-digit
suffix (001 to 999) and generates various probability files. Once these
probability <a href="S321.htm">files</a> have been created, the 
concentration distribution at a single location can also be viewed using
this menu by entering a latitude-longitude location. The nearest grid point
will be selected and the concentration values are retrieved from the 
prob{xx} files, which represent the various points on the box plot. In the
illustration shown below, the limits of the box represent the quartiles 
(25th and 75th percentiles), the whisker extensions show the 10th and 90th
percentiles, and the circles show the 5th and 95th percentiles.  The median
value is shown by the line through the box, while the mean is shown by the
plus symbol. Up to 12 time periods can be shown in one plot. The graphic is
always named <i>boxplots.ps</i>.

<p>A second graphic called <i>ensplots.ps</i> is always produced using the
individual ensemble concentration files. The abcissa and ordinate is
identical to the boxplot, but the contents show the actual concentration
values identified by member number, where the number is the same as the
concentration file suffix.</p>
