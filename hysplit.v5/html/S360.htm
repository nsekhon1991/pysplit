<p><h2>Concentration / Help</h2></p>

<p>The concentration menu tab is composed of six main sections:
setting up the simulation, executing the model, displaying the
concentrations, various utility programs for converting the output
to other formats, configuring special simulations, and simulations
in a multi-processor environment. The model can be entirely
configured and executed through the menu. However for experienced
users, each component may be run independently from the command
line.</p>

<p>In the <a href="S310.htm">Concentration Setup</a>
menu, the entire purpose of the GUI is to
configure the model's input <i>CONTROL</i> file. This is a text
file that configures the simulation parameters. Once the input
parameters are set to their desired value, the model is executed
from the <a href="S320.htm">Run Standard Model</a> menu tab. When
complete, the output window is closed and <a href="S330.htm">Display
Options</a> menu is used to draw and display the concentration 
contours from the model's binary concentration output file. The 
<a href="S356.htm">Special Simulations</a> menu is used to configure
several different customized simultaneous for ensemble applications,
source-receptor matrices, and some simple chemistry simulations.
The <a href="S358.htm">Multi-processor</a> tab invokes some of the
same special simulations but will only run under a multi-processor-
computing environment. Normally this is not an option available
under MS Windows.</p>

<p>For inexperienced users, a review of the <a href="S361.htm">
Quick Start Help</a> menu is highly suggested, which goes through
a concentration computation step-by-step using the example
meteorological data file.</p>
