<P><h2>Meteorology / Utilities / GIS to Shapefile</h2></P>

<P>A utility tab is provided in the meteorology, trajectory, and concentration menus that 
will convert an ESRI generate format text file to a Shapefile for import into ArcView or 
comparable GIS applications. The &quot;ascii2shp&quot; conversion software is available 
under the GNU license from the Free Software foundation.  The conversion can be run from 
the command line or the GUI menu shown below.</P>

<P>Normally the fields will be blank when the menu is first invoked.  Prior to creating the 
shapefiles it is necessary to create the "<I>Generate</I>&quot; text file which contains the 
latitude-longitude points of each contour as created by the contouring programs available 
through the display menus.  Checking the GIS box in the menu (-a1 option on the command line) 
creates these files.  All generate format files start with <I>GIS</I> and end with <I>.txt</I>. 
The remainder of the file name depends upon the application from which it was created.  However 
in all applications, the two-digit string prior to the <I>.txt</I> identifies the frame number.  
There is one GIS output file per frame. Use the upper browse button to set the generate
format input file name.</p>

<p>The generate files can be converted to shapefiles consisting of points or lines (for
trajectories), and lines or polygons (for concentrations). Polygons are closed lines. A polygon
that runs off the map display is becomes a line and may not be displayed correctly if
treated as a polygon.</p>

<p>Normally the <i>base.dbf</i> file will contain only the minimum amount of information.
However, the trajectory and concentration plotting programs automatically create an enhanced
attributes file (GIS_???.att). To add this information to <i>base.dbf</i>, check one of the
enhanced attributes options.</p>

</P>In the lower text entry box enter the base name of the output shapefiles.  All output files
will be created in the working directory.  Note that depending upon the upper level menu from
which the conversion was called, the shapefile conversion will be either for lines (meteorology),
points (trajectory), or polygons (concentration), although the option can be superseded by the
checkbox selection.</P>

<b>What is a Shapefile?</b>

<P>The Shapefile format is a working and interchange format promulgated by ESRI for
simple vector data with attributes. It is apparently the only file format that can be
edited in ARCView 2/3, and can also be exported and imported in Arc/Info. An excellent white
paper on the shapefile format is available from ESRI, but it is .pdf format, so you will need
Adobe Acrobat to browse it. The file format actually consists of four files.</P>
<ul>
<li>XXX.shp - holds the actual vertices.
<li>XXX.shx - hold index data pointing to the structures in the .shp file.
<li>XXX.dbf - holds the attributes in xBase (dBase) format.
<li>XXX.prj - holds the projection information.
</ul>
