<p><h2>Advanced / Configuration Setup / Set Directories</h2></p>

<p>The installation program installs all code and executables to your
selected directory, and creates a shortcut on the Window's desktop to
/guicode/hysplit.tcl with the <i>Start In</i> directory as your selected 
default. On Unix systems the link would appear in the /working directory.
When the GUI is first started, it looks for the supplemental programs such
as Ghostscript, Ghostview, ImageMagick, and Tcl/tk in certain standard
directories, and writes those paths to a file called <i>default_exec</i>.
If this file already exists, those locations are used instead of the default
search paths.  The directories specified in this file may be edited through
the <i>Set Directories</i> menu tab. Copying the <i>default_exec</i> file
to another computer with a different directory structure may cause the GUI
to fail to open. In these situations, either delete the file, or manually
edit the file to reflect the correct directory structure.</p>

<p>The <i>default_exec</i> values either reflect a directory location, a file
name, or a directory/executable name. The content is mostly self-explanatory.
Under UNIX systems, the X-windows directory should point to the location of the
<i>xterm</i> program. This is optional. If the directory is defined, then many
of the programs called by the GUI will run in their own <i>xterm</i> window.</p>

<p>The Anaconda3 environment path is necessary for Python scripts. With Anaconda,
users can create an environment and manage python packages in it. Each environment
is self-contained and users can test out a new version of package without affecting
other environments. For hysplit use, it is recommended to create the hysplit
environment and have the Anaconda3 environment path on the graphical user
interface point to the environment. For Windows 10 users, the environment path
would be C:/Users/YOUR_USER_NAME/AppData/Local/Continuum/anaconda3/envs/hysplit
when default values were used for Anaconda installation.</p>
