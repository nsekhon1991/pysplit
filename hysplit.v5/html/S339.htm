<p><h2>Concentration / Display / Time-of-Arrival</h2></p>

<p>Time of arrival graphic (isochron) shows the time after the start of the
simulation that the concentration exceeds the given threshold concentration
at each concentration grid cell. The default contour interval (-1) uses the
concentration averaging period. Otherwise, the time difference field should
be set to hours. A text label with release information may be printed below 
the threshold through the <a href="S418.htm">LABELS.CFG</a> file.  </p>

<p>The GUI and the command line options are similar with the command line
syntax as follows: <b>USAGE: isochron -[options(default)]</b></p>

<ul>
-c[color fill no:0 yes:(1)] : the =0 option results in contours<br>
-d[difference in hours between contours (-1)]<br>
-f[frames: (0)-all frames one file, 1-one frame per file] : multiple
frames can only be due to multiple levels or species in the input file<br>
-i[input file name (cdump)] : the input file needs to contain multiple time period<br>
-j[graphics map background file (arlmap)] : the shape file option is not available<br>
-n[number of contours (12)] : only 12 contours fit across the display<br>
-o[output name (toa)] : the output file represents all time periods<br>
-p[Process file name suffix: (ps) or process ID]
-t[threshold value (1.0E-36)]<br>




</ul>

<p>In the 144 hour duration example simulation shown below, the concentration field
was output every six hours, the contour interval was set to 12 hours, and the 
threshold to 0.1E-15 . The one hour duration release took about 72 h to reach 
Hudson's Bay and about 144 h to reach into the Atlantic off the east coast of the U.S.</p>
