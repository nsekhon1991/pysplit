<p><h2>Concentration / Display / Ensemble / View Map</h2></p>

<p>Multiple concentration output files from the ensemble or variance
dispersion simulation should have been previously processed in the  
ensemble <a href="S321.htm">Create Files</a> tab of the display menu.
This step would have created fourteen probability output files in
the working directory. These files are used to generate all graphics. The 
selected files are then plotted using <i>concplot</i> according to
the menu options. An illustration of the <i>View map</i> menu
is shown below.</p>

<p>The menu includes some of the standard display program (<i>concplot</i>)
mapping choices, such as background file, output file name, zoom factor,
and employment of FORTRAN- or Python-based implementation.</p>

<p>The menu permits a choice of six different ensemble output display
options:</p>

<ol>
<li>The <b>number</b> of ensemble members at each grid point with 
concentrations greater than zero shows the spatial distribution of 
the number of members (<b>cnumb</b>).</li>

<li>The <b>mean</b> concentration of all ensemble members (<b>cmean</b>).</li>

<li>The <b>variance</b> or the mean square difference between individual 
members and the mean (<b>cvarn</b>).</li>

<li>The <b>coefficient of variation</b> of all ensemble members expressed as
the &radic;Cvarn*100/Cmean (<b>ccoev</b>).</li>

<li>The <b>probability of concentration</b> produces contours that give the
probability of exceeding a fixed concentration value at one of three levels:
1% of the maximum concentration (<b>cmax01</b>), 10% of the maximum (<b>cmax10</b>), 
and the maximum concentration (<b>cmax00</b>). The concentration level for the 
probability display is shown on the graphic with the pollutant identification 
field set to something like C14, where 14 represents the concentration to the 
power of 10<sup>-14</sup>.</li>

<li>The <b>concentration at percentile</b> levels shows the concentration contours 
of areas where concentrations will be exceeded only at the given probability level.
Although several output levels are computed, the probability level choices through
the menu are limited to 50, 90, and 95th percentiles (<b>prob[75|90|95]</b>).</li>
</ol>
