<p><h2>Trajectory / Setup Run</h2></p>

<p>When the <i>Setup Run</i> tab is executed, the
<i>default_traj</i> file is read and the current parameter values
are loaded. The menu for the example simulation
(<i>sample_traj</i>) is shown below. The options shown on the menu
correspond with the various lines in the CONTROL file. See the
discussion of the <a href="S262.htm">control file format</a> for a
more detailed description for each of these parameters. However
there are some features of the GUI that require additional
explanation.</p>

<p>Clicking the <i>Setup Starting Locations</i> tab brings up the
menu shown below. If the number of starting locations were to have
been changed from the default value of three on the main menu, then
there would be that number of starting location lines set on the
menu, all with the same latitude and longitude. These could then be
manually edited for different locations or starting heights. The starting
height is by default defined to be above-ground-level (AGL) unless this
is changed in the Advanced/Configuration/Trajectory menu.
Another possibility would be to click on the <i>List</i> tab, which
brings up a list of pre-selected starting locations from a file
called <i>plants.txt</i>, which can be found in the
<i>../hysplit/working</i> directory. This file can be edited to reflect
starting locations of interest to the user.</p>

<p>Another important feature of the main menu is how to select or
add meteorological data files. The <i>Clear</i> button will erase
all file selections, then pressing the <i>Add Meteorology Files</i>
tab brings up the file selection dialog shown below. Select a file
and click <i>Open</i> and the file will be added to the main menu.
For each additional file, it is necessary to click again on the
<i>Add Meteorology Files</i> tab. With each new file the selected
files number is incremented by one.</p>

<p>Once the simulation is configured as required, click the
<i>Save</i> menu tab. This causes the GUI menu to over-write the
values in <i>default_traj</i>. Note that the format of
<i>default_traj</i> is identical to the <i>CONTROL</i> file.
Clicking on <i>Save</i> closes the menu and then when the 
<a href="S220.htm">Run Model</a> tab is executed, <i>default_traj</i>
is first copied to <i>CONTROL</i>, and then the trajectory model is run.</p>

<p>When the GUI menu system is restarted, it loads the last values
stored in <i>default_traj</i>. The <i>default_traj</i> file may
also be saved to another name to permit future similar simulations
to be set up more quickly. This option is available through the <a
href="S211.htm">Save As and Retrieve</a> menu tab of the setup
menu.</p>
