<p><h2>Advanced / Help</h2></p>

<p>This section provides some guidance in configuring the model to perform
certain specialized calculations. These include deciding between 
<a href="S441.htm#particle_puff">particle or puff</a> releases, dealing with 
<a href="S441.htm#continuous_emit">continuous emissions</a>, creating an file with
<a href="S441.htm#emit_time">time variations</a> of the emission rate, unit-source
<a href="S441.htm#emit_tcm">simulations</a> with time-varying emissions,
<a href="S441.htm#area_source">area source</a> emissions,
<a href="S441.htm#multiple">multiple pollutants</a>, pollutant 
<a href="S441.htm#transform">transformations</a>, atmospheric 
<a href="S441.htm#chemistry">chemistry</a>,
<a href="S441.htm#deposition">deposition</a> and decay,
<a href="S441.htm#compilation">compilation limits</a>, scripting for 
<ahref="S441.htm#automation">automation</a> applications, 
<a href="S441.htm#back_dispersion">backward dispersion</a> for source attribution, 
configuring the time or spatial <a href="S441.htm#emit_time">
variation of the emission</a> rate using an input file, and how to compute
deposited pollutant transport on <a href="S441.htm#sfc_water">ocean water surfaces</a>.
The Advanced menu is composed of four sections.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The <a href="S413.htm"><b>Configuration Setup</b></a> menu permits the
creation and modification of the <i>SETUP.CFG</i> namelist file for either
<a href="S411.htm">Trajectory</a> or Air <a href="S412.htm">Concentration</a>
calculations. The namelist file is a variable length file that is used to set
additional parameters that can be used to modify the nature of the simulation.
The namelist file is not required because all the namelist variables take on
default values when the <i>SETUP.CFG</i> file is not found. The same namelist
file can be used for either trajectory or air concentration simulations but
only certain variables are applicable to each simulation. Supplemental
<a href="S414.htm">plot labeling</a> options are available, a menu to configure
a <a href="S415.htm"> dynamic sampler</a> that can move in space and time for
use with the concentration simulation, and a menu to configure the default
<a href="S416.htm"> directory structure</a> and location of executable programs
used by the GUI. More complex point source emissions scenarios can be defined
by creating the <a href="S417.htm">EMITIMES</a> emissions file.</p></li><br>

<li><p>The <b>View MESSAGES</b> menu is used to display the 
<a href="S443.htm">diagnostic message file</a>. For all trajectory or concentration
simulations, diagnostic information is written to standard output until the
initialization process has completed. At that point the <i>MESSAGE</i> file is
opened and subsequent diagnostic and certain error messages are written to this
file. If the model does not complete properly, some additional diagnostic 
information may be obtained from this file.</p></li><br>
