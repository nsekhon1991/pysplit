<p><h2>Trajectory / Help </h2></p>

<p>The trajectory menu tab is composed of five main sections:
setting up the simulation, executing the model, displaying the
trajectory, converting the graphic to other formats, and
running special simulations. The model is configured and
executed through the menu and results displayed. However for
experienced users, each component could be run independently from the
command line and the <a href="S262.htm">CONTROL</a>
file could be created using any text editor.</p>

<p>In the <a href="S210.htm">Trajectory Setup</a> menu the entire 
purpose of the GUI is to configure the model's input <i>CONTROL</i>
file. This is a text file that configures the simulation parameters.
Once the input parameters are set to their desired value, the model
is executed from the <a href="S220.htm">Run Model</a> menu
tab. When complete, the output window is closed and the
<a href="S230.htm">Trajectory Display</a> menu is used to draw and
display the trajectory from the <a href="S263.htm">endpoints</a> output
file. <a href="S253.htm">The Special Runs</a> menu is used to
configure several different customized simultaneous multiple trajectory
simulations.</p>

<p>For inexperienced users, a review of the <a href="S261.htm">
Quick Start Help</a> is highly suggested, which goes through the 
trajectory computation step-by-step using the example 
meteorological data file.</p>
