<P><h2>GUI Overview</h2></P>

<P>Although the model can be configured and run manually from the command line, it is 
usually much quicker to use the GUI.  A summary of the main features in each of the 
primary GUI menus is reviewed below. More detailed help information can be found
with the help button associated with each specific menu.</P>

<P><B>Meteorology / ARL Data FTP</B></P>

<UL>
<P><A HREF="S111.htm">Forecasts</A> - Links to only the most recent forecast data for a
variety of different meteorological models available on the ARL FTP server.  The data 
have already processed to a HYSPLIT compatible format. Appended data are defined as a 
combination of analysis and short forecasts (e.g. 0h and +3h appended with each new 6h 
cycle) that are operationally maintained as a rolling archive valid for 48 hours prior 
to the most recent forecast cycle.</P>

<P><A HREF="S112.htm">ARL Archive</A> - Provides access to the long-term data archives
at ARL for various meteorological data that have already been formatted for use by HYSPLIT.
These data include the global GFS, GDAS, and NCAR/NCEP reanalysis. Files inclusive to North
America include various versions of NAM, HRRR, and WRF.</P>

<P><A HREF="S101.htm">Set Server</A> - A generic menu that can be customized to open
different backup or user defined FTP servers to download pre-formatted HYSPLIT compatible
meteorological forecasts.</P>
</ul>

<P><B>Meteorology / Convert to ARL</B></P>

<ul>
<P>Many of the scripts linked in this menu will convert various data file formats
into the data format used by HYSPLIT. GRIB version 2 is not yet supported. However,
conversion software from GRIB-2 to GRIB-1 can be obtained from several different
sources (NOAA-NCEP, ECMWF, WMO). All files must be on the local computer. FTP is
no longer supported through these menus.</P>

<P><A HREF="S120.htm">WRF-ARW</A> - Processes fields from NCARs Advanced Research
WRF model into the ARL format. The data conversion routines require NetCDF routines
currently supported only on UNIX or LINUX platforms.</P>

<P><A HREF="S125.htm">Global Lat-Lon</A> - Archived GRIB-1 fields from the global model of 
ECMWF or NOAA may be processed locally into ARL format. The procedure is designed only to work 
with archive data from their current operational model, where the last four digits of
the file name represent the day.</P>

<P><A HREF="S126.htm">ERA-40</A> - Archive GRIB-1 fields from the ECMWF ERA-40 reanalysis
may be processed locally into ARL format.  These files must already be present. The procedure
is designed only to work with the ERA-40 data files. Three different file types must be
downloaded for this conversion: 3-d fields, 2-d surface fields, and one invariant field.</P>

<P><A HREF="S128.htm">User Entered</A> - This menu tab is intended to convert user
entered meteorological data to the ARL packed HYSPLIT compatible format. The conversion 
program will create a data file with one or more time periods containing a uniform field
in space and height but varying in time. The grid is centered over the location specified
in the main menu and covers a 50 by 50 km domain.</P>
</ul>

<P><B>Meteorology / Display Data</B></P>

<ul>
<P><A HREF="S130.htm">Check File</A> - A program to list the information in the meteorology
file index record as well as the ASCII header portion of each data record.</p>

<P><A HREF="S131.htm">Contour Map</A> - A simple postscript contouring program that can 
be used to view the data fields in any ARL packed meteorological data set.  The output 
is always written to a file called contour.ps.  Multiple time periods may be 
processed.</P>

<P><A HREF="S132.htm">Text Profile</A> - This program is used to extract the 
meteorological data profile interpolated to a user selected latitude-longitude position.  
The raw data values at the surface and each level are output on the left while 
temperature converted to potential temperature and winds rotated from grid orientation 
to true are shown on the right.  Output is shown on the screen and is also written to 
a file called profile.txt. </P>

<P><A HREF="S133.htm">Grid Domain</A> - Program to generate a map showing the domain of 
the meteorological data grid with marks at each selected data grid point.  Output is 
written to the file showgrid.ps. </P>
</ul>

<P><B>Utilities</B></P>
<ul>

<P><A HREF="S134.htm">Convert Postscript</A> - Converts any Postscript file to another 
format using ImageMagick. Enter the name of the Postscript file and the desired name 
of the output file, with the file suffix indicating the desired conversion.</P>

<P><A HREF="S135.htm">GIS to Shapefile</A> - When the GIS output option is selected in 
selected display programs an ASCII text file (in generate format) is created that 
contains the latitude-longitude values of each contour.  This GIS text file can be 
converted to an ERSI Arc View shapefile.  This menu tab is available from three 
different points. From the meteorology tab the conversion is &quot;line&quot;, from the 
trajectory tab the conversion is &quot;points&quot;, and from the concentration tab the 
conversion is &quot;polygon&quot;.</P>
</ul>

<B><P>Trajectory</P></B>

<ul>
<P><A HREF="S261.htm">Quick Start</A> - menu tab can be used to run any simulation in 
one-step. The last configuration will be used for the simulation. The menu brings up a 
global map with the current source location shown as a blue dot which can be moved to
a new location. The <i>Run Example</i> menu tab resets the control and namelist files
and reruns the example case. This can be used as a starting point for configurations
that have been corrupted.</p>

<P><A HREF="S210.htm">Setup Run</A> - This menu is used to write the CONTROL
file that defines all the model simulation parameters.  Note that once a simulation
has been defined it can be <A HREF="S211.htm">&quot;Saved As&quot; and later &quot;
Retrieved.&quot;</A>  Note that the setup must be &quot;Saved&quot; before proceeding
to the &quot;Run Model&quot; step.</P>

<P><A HREF="S220.htm">Run Model</A> - The selection opens the window for
standard output and starts the execution of &quot;hyts_std.exe&quot;.  Incremental 
progress is reported on WinNT and later systems, however on LINUX the display 
remains frozen until the calculation has completed (a beep will sound).</P>

<P><A HREF="S230.htm">Display</A> - Display options are available to label 
the time increment along the trajectory and the amount of white space surrounding the 
trajectory on the map.  The HIRES option limits the domain to just fit the trajectory.  
Output is written to the file trajplot.ps. The plot title can be defined in a file 
called <a href="S230.htm#labels">labels.cfg</a> which should be placed in the \working 
directory. The special <A HREF="S231.htm">frequency</A> display can be used to
plot the spatial frequency distribution of multiple trajectory simulations.</P>

<P><A HREF="S253.htm">Special Runs</A> - The <A HREF="S253.htm#ensemble">
Ensemble</A> option invokes a special executable that will run multiple trajectories 
from the same location, with each trajectory using meteorological data slightly offset 
from the origin point.  The <A HREF="S253.htm#matrix">Matrix</A> option simultaneously 
runs a regular grid of trajectory starting locations. Also available are multiple 
trajectory options in both <a href="S253.htm#multi_time">time</a> and 
<a href="S253.htm#multi_space"> space</a> as well as the daily menu to run a series of 
<a href="S254.htm">automated</a> trajectories for multiple days or months per 
execution. Multiple trajectories can also be <A HREF="S255.htm">clustered</A>.</P>
</ul>

<B><P>Concentration</P></B>

<ul>
<P><A HREF="S361.htm">Quick Start</A> - menu tab can be used to run any simulation in 
one-step or rerun the example simulation. It's functionality is similar to the trajectory
quick start menu.</P>

<P><A HREF="S310.htm">Setup Run</A> - The menu is almost identical to the 
Trajectory Setup menu except for the added tab for &quot;<A HREF="S311.htm">Pollutant, 
Deposition, and Grids</A>&quot;, which is used to customize the concentration 
computation.  Unlike trajectories, which are terminated at the top of the model domain, 
pollutant particles reflect at the model top.</P>

<P><A HREF="S320.htm">Run Model</A> - Similar in function to 
trajectory run menu, executes &quot;hycs_std.exe&quot;.</P>

<P><A HREF="S330.htm">Display</A> - Output is written to concplot.ps.  
Options on the menu permit concentration contours to be dynamically scaled to the 
maximum for each map (default) or fixed for all maps based upon the highest value on 
any one map. Other display programs are available for the color fill of 
<a href="S338.htm">uncontoured gridded data</a> or the horizontal or vertical display 
of the <a href="S332.htm">particle distributions</a> and the computation of plume
<a href="S339.htm">arrival times</a>.

Note that the units label as well as the plot title can be defined in a file called
<a href="S418.htm">LABELS.CFG</a> which should be placed in the \working 
directory. Special display programs are available for a source-receptor 
<a href="S335.htm">matrix</a>, <a href="S334.htm">ensemble</a>, and
<a href="S355.htm">statistical</a> simulation outputs.</P>
</ul>

<B><P>Utilities</P></B>

<ul>
<P><A HREF="S341.htm">Convert to ASCII</A> - Writes an ASCII file for each time period 
of concentration output with one record for every grid point that has a non-zero 
concentration value.  Each record is identified by the ending date and time of the 
sample and the latitude and longitude of each grid point.  The output file name is 
constructed from the name of the [input file]_[julian day]_[output hour].  Some other 
output options are available.</P>

<P><A HREF="S342.htm">Grid to Station</A> - This program is used to extract the time-
series of concentration values for a specific location.  That location may be specified 
by a single latitude-longitude through the GUI or multiple stations may be defined by 
entering the name of a file that contains an integer station number, latitude, and 
longitude on each record.  The output is written to con2stn.txt which can be read by 
the time series plotting program to produce the file timeplot.ps.  Note that the time 
series plot is always in integer units and therefore may require the specification of a 
units multiplication factor.</P>

<P><A HREF="S345.htm">Convert to DATEM</A> - Conceptually similar to Grid-to-Station,
this menu is used to convert a binary file to the DATEM format and then compute model
performance statistics. A data file with measurement data in DATEM format must already
exist, and the conversion program will match each model calculated concentration with a
measurement, compute performance statistics, and display a scatter diagram of measured
and calculated values.</P>

<A HREF="S344.htm">Merge Binary Files</A> - Multiple binary concentration files may
be added together for a sum, or the maximum value is retained at each grid, or one of
the input files may be used as a zero mask, resulting in zero concentrations in the
other file when the mask file shows a non-zero value.</P>
</ul>

<B><P>Special Runs</P></B>

<ul>
<P><A HREF="S352.htm">Daily</A> - Runs a script to rerun the last dispersion model
configuration each time with a different starting day and time for days or months. Output 
files are labeled with the starting time or a sequential number. This script can also
be used to create a time dependent Transfer Coefficient Matrix (TCM) when the run length
is reduced with each iteration so that all dispersion simulations end at the same time.</p>

<P><A HREF="S356.htm#run_matrix">Matrix</A> - Runs the matrix pre-processor to create
a <i>CONTROL</i> file with a grid of starting locations. The source-receptor conversion
option needs to be selected in the advanced menu to create the coefficient matrix
required for source attribution applications.</p>
 
<P><A HREF="S357.htm">Geolocation</A> - Runs a special pre-processor that reads a file
of measured sampling data to automatically configure a <i>CONTROL</i> file for each
sample which is then run in a script to create a source attribution function for each
measured sample.</p>

<P><A HREF="S356.htm#run_ensemble">Ensemble / Meteorology</A> - An application similar to the
trajectory ensemble, in that multiple simulations are run each with a different offset in
the meteorological data to create an ensemble showing the sensitivity of the simulation
to gradients in the meteorological data fields.</p>

<P><A HREF="S356.htm#run_variance">Ensemble / Turbulence</A> - Instead of starting each
simulation with the same random number seed, multiple simulations are run, each with a
different seed, which then shows the concentration sensitivity to the turbulence.</p>

<P><A HREF="S356.htm#run_physics">Ensemble / Physics</A> - The physics ensemble varies
different turbulence and dispersion namelist parameters from the base simulation to 
develop an ensemble showing the sensitivity of the calculation to various model physics
assumptions.</p>

<P><A HREF="S359.htm">Global</A> - The global special run invokes an executable that
contains a global Eulerian module to permit particle mass to be transferred to the 
global model at a specified age. A concentration output grid for each computation is
created. One representing local/regional scale plumes, the other the contribution to
global background concentrations.</p>
 
<P><A HREF="S356.htm#run_dust">Dust Storm</A> - Invokes a pre-processor that creates
a <i>CONTROL</i> file with each location within the selected computational domain that
contains a desert land-use designation. This option should be used in conjunction with 
the advanced menu option to turn on the dust emission module.</p>

<P><A HREF="S365.htm">Daughter Products</A> - Invokes a pre-processor that creates a
DAUGHTER.TXT file containing the daughter nuclides produced by a parent nuclide 
along with the half-life and branching fractions. In addition a <i>CONTROL</i> file 
is modified to include the daughter product information. 
This option should be used in conjunction with the advanced menu option to turn on 
the daughter product module and set MAXDIM to the number of daughters.</p>

</ul>

<B><P>Advanced Topics</P></B>

<ul>
<P>Contains several menus for <A HREF="S440.htm">custom model configurations</A> that 
can be used to change the nature of the simulation and the way the model interprets 
various input parameters.  These menus would be used to configure matrix, ensemble, 
global, pollutant transformations, and model initialization options.</P>

<P><A HREF="S411.htm">Trajectory Configuration</A> - Creates the <i>SETUP.CFG</i>
namelist file for trajectory calculations.</p>

<P><A HREF="S412.htm">Concentration Configuration</A> - Creates the <i>SETUP.CFG</i>
namelist file for concentration-dispersion calculations.</p>

<P><A HREF="S359.htm">Global Configuration</A> - Creates the <i>GEMPARM.CFG</i>
namelist file to configure the global Eulerian model subroutines.</p>

<P><A HREF="S415.htm">Dynamic Sampling</A> - Creates a virtual sampler that can fly
through the computational domain, either passively with the wind or with a pre-defined
velocity vector.</p>

<P><A HREF="S417.htm">Emissions File</A> - Opens a simple editor to create a special
emission file that can define point sources that vary in space, time, and intensity.</p>

</ul>

<B><P>Center Reset Button</P></B>
<p>This will cause any changes to the GUI variables to be set back to the sample trajectory
and concentration simulation case which uses the oct1618.BIN sample meteorological file.
This button loads the sample_conc and sample_traj control files from the working directory.
