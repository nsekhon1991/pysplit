<p><h2>Concentration / Utilities / Convert to Station</h2></p>

<p>The purpose of the <i>Convert to Station</i> utility menu (also called time
series data extraction) is to list concentrations at specific latitude-longitude
locations by extracting that information to a text file. The menu also has an
option to produce a time series plot at one or more of the stations or a KML
formatted file suitable for display by Google Earth. An illustration of the 
menu is shown below. The concentration grid names are determined from the 
<i>Concentration / Setup Run</i> menu tabs and therefore the setup menu needs
to be called prior to opening this menu. The species and height values are index
numbers starting at one. A height index of 1 is the data at the first output
level, regardless of its actual height value. The date field can be written
as a fractional Julian day (for plotting) or using a MM/DD/YYYY field
(for spreadsheets) with or without an index record. The no index record option
is used to concatenate multiple files.</p>

<p>The TCM checkbox is used to flag the input file as having been created
using the <a href="S628.htm">ICHEM=10</a> namelist option. There is no specific
marker in the concentration to indicate that the file is in this format. The file
contains multiple pollutants, each associated with a different time of release.
The TCM flag also causes the first output time group with each record to be 
associated with the time of release rather than the time of the sample 
collection. The second time group of the record becomes the start time of the
sample collection.</p>

<p>Similar to the other menus in the utility section, the input concentration
file must be defined in the <a href="S310.htm">Concentration Setup</a> menu.
The menu options correspond to the <a href="#con2stn">command line</a>
options of the <i>con2stn</i> extraction program. There are two options that
can be used to define an extraction location. A station location can be 
defined directly as an entry in the menu, or a list of stations can be 
defined using an input file. If the input file does not exist, it can be
created by using the <i>New File</i> button. In this example illustration,
a file has been defined with three locations that are within the plume of the
example simulation. The file consists of three records, one for each station:</p>

<center><p><img src="Image36.gif" width="79" height="33"></p></center>

<p>The extraction program is called <i>con2stn</i> and for these three stations,
produces the output file shown below, called by default <i>con2stn.txt</i>. The
base name of the output file (<i>con2stn</i>) can be changed in the menu. 
In contrast to the simulation shown in all the previous examples, in this
case the output averaging time was decreased from 12 hours to one hour,
to generate a smoother looking graphic.</p>

<center><p><img src="Image37.gif" width="307" height="261"></p></center>

<p>The output file shows the Julian day, month, day, and hour of the sample
start; day and hour of sample ending time, and the concentrations for each
station (location selected by latitude-longitude). The format of each output
record is as follows:</p>
<ul>
F8.3, 6I4 - Starting: Julian day, year, month, day, hour; Ending: day, hour<br>
XF10 - Concentration value at X stations<br>
</ul>

<p>The lower section of the GUI is used to create a simple time series concentration
plot of the concentration time series or an output file (<i>con2stn.kml</i>)
suitable for display by Google Earth. The <i>con2stn.txt</i> file is created first
which is then read by the Google Earth conversion program 
(<a href="#stn2ge"><i>stn2ge</i></a>).  
</p>

<p>For time series data, one or more stations may be plotted. The plotting feature
is also available through the <a href="#timeplot">command line</a>. The option is
selected from the <b>Display Time Series</b> checkbox. The program, <i>timeplot</i>,
reads the data file produced by the <i>con2stn</i> conversion program and plots the
concentration values to the <i>timeplot.ps</i> output file. The illustration for
the previous text file is shown below.</p>

<center><p><img src="Image38.gif" width="398" height="434"></p></center>

<p>There are only two plot options supported through the GUI: linear or 
logarithmic ordinate scaling. If integer ordinate units are desired then it may
be necessary to specify a units conversion factor, in this case 10<sup>15</sup>,
to create data in the text file that can be plotted. With the log scaling option,
the conversion factor can be set to 1.0, and the ordinate scale will cover the
appropriate order-of-magnitude range to plot all the data.</p>

<p><a name="con2stn"><b>Command Line Options - con2stn</b></a></p>

<p>The program can be run from the command line or through interactive prompts
from the keyboard. The command line argument syntax is that there should be no
space between the switch and options. The command line arguments can appear
in any order: <b>con2stn -[option {value}]</b></p>
<ul>
 -a[rotation angle:latitude:longitude]<br>
 -c[input to output concentration multiplier]<br>
 -d[mm/dd/yyyy format: (0)=no 1=w-Label 2=wo-Label]<br>
   <ul>The default date format is to write a fractional Julian date in the first
   output field. This format is required for plotting purposes. However, a more
   conventional month/day/year format can be selected, which is more compatible with
   spreadsheet applications. In the first option (=1) an informational header record
   is written. In the other option (=2) the header record is excluded, which is 
   more convenient when appending multiple files.</ul>
 -h[half-life-days (one -h entry for each pollutant)]<br>
 -i[input concentration file name]<br>
   <ul>Unspecified file names will result in a standard input prompt.</ul>
 -m[maximum number of stations (200)]<br>
 -o[output concentration file name]<br>
 -p[pollutant index (1) or 0 for all pollutants]<br>
   <ul>Level and pollutant index values can be selected for files with multiple levels
   and species. Setting zero (0) for either index forces the output to be the record
   format rather than the column format. Record format contains the index numbers for
   the pollutant and level.</ul>
 -r[record format 0=record (1)=column 2=datem]<br>
   <ul>The default output format is to create multiple columns, one for each station,
   for a selected pollutant and level. Setting the value to one formats the output as one
   record for each station, level, and pollutant. A value of two sets the output to the
   <a href="S345.htm">DATEM format</a>.</ul>
 -s[station list file name (contains: id lat lon)]<br>
   <ul>The station positions can be read from a file (space or comma delimited) with
   the first field being an integer that represents the location identification, 
   followed by the decimal location in latitude and longitude.</ul>
 -t[transfer coefficient processing]<br>
 -x[(n)=neighbor or i for interpolation]<br>
   <ul>The default interpolation method (-xn) is to use the value at nearest grid 
   point to each latitude-longitude position, otherwise bilinear interpolation (-xi) is
   used.</ul>
 -z[level index (1) or 0 for all levels]<br>
</ul>

<p><a name="stn2ge"><b>Command Line Options - stn2ge [option {value}]</b></a></p>
<ul>
-i[input text file name] contains data in the format output from <i>con2stn</i><br>
-s[station list file name] same file used as input to <i>con2stn</i><br>
-o[google earth output filename (less .kml)]<br>
</ul>

<p><a name="timeplot"><b>Command Line Options - timeplot [option {value}]</b></a></p>
<ul>
-i[input concentration file name] contains data in the same format as output from <i>con2stn</i><br>
-m[minimum ordinate value (0.0)]<br>
-n[sequential station number]<br>
   <ul>For files with multiple stations select the station to plot; default for multiple stations
   is to plot all stations; several stations can be selected to plot by appending station numbers
   with the plus symbol: hence -n3+5+6 will plot stations 3, 5, and 6.</ul>
-p[draw only points, no connecting line]<br>
-y[The default is linear ordinate scaling. The flag sets y-axis log scaling.]<br>
-z[three character time label]<br>
</ul>

<p>Note that multiple pollutants and levels are not supported. Timeplot labels can also be 
customized by creating a <i>LABELS.CFG</i> file. See the 
<a href="S418.htm">Border Labels</a> discussion for more information on this file format.</p>
