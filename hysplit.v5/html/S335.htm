<p><h2>Concentration / Display / Source-Receptor View</h2></p>

<p>This menu option permits the extraction of information for a
specific <a href="S356.htm">source or receptor</a> if the original
model simulation was configured to produce a source-receptor matrix
formatted output file. The model should have been run with the
matrix option set in the configuration menu. This results in a
special concentration output file that may be called a source-
receptor matrix, such that each column may be considered a
receptor location and each row a pollutant source location. The
display program under this menu tab permits the contouring of any
row or column.</p>

<p>If the matrix option was not set in the <a href="S412.htm">
Advanced Concentration</a> configuration tab, then the output
file produced is a simple concentration output file, where
the concentrations from all the sources of the defined matrix are
summed on a single concentration output grid. Source-receptor
information cannot be extracted from such a file.</p>

<p>When a location is selected in the menu, a special program is
called to extract that location from the concentration matrix output
file and then write a standard concentration file for that location.
The standard concentration display program is then used to display
the information in the extracted file. The source-receptor matrix
binary extraction file name will default to <i>SRM_{original file name}</i>,
but can be changed in the menu. The <i>Display Matrix</i> menu, shown in
the illustration below, automatically creates the extraction file,
calls the standard display program <i>concplot</i>, and provides for
additional custom label information to identify the plot as a source-receptor
concentration matrix.</p>

<p>The menu consists of the standard display options such as the
map background file, output file name, zoom factor, and the
selection of the extraction method: source or receptor. A latitude
and longitude point needs to be entered for all extractions.
Selection of the <i>"source"</i> extraction method means that the
location entered is considered to be the source location and the 
resulting output is a contour map is just a conventional air 
concentration simulation showing concentrations from that source.
The <i>"receptor"</i> extraction method means that the location 
entered is considered to be the receptor location and the output
is a map of how much air concentration each source contributes to 
the selected receptor. Note that turning on the "normalization" flag 
divides all concentrations by the sum of all concentrations at each 
grid point, resulting in a map that represents a fractional 
contribution. In addition, a concentration conversion factor
can be defined, which will be applied to the binary file before
it is contoured.</p>
