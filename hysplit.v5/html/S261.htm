<p><h2>Trajectory / Quick Start Help</h2></p>

<p>After the initial installation, the model will be configured
to run the example case discussed in more detail below. The "Quick
Start" menu tab can be used to run the example or the previous
simulation in one-step. For more detailed simulation configurations,
follow the steps below.</p>

<p>The easiest way to run the model is to use the GUI menu to
create the model's input <i>CONTROL</i> file. For the purposes of
this demonstration appropriate meteorological files are provided.
If for some reason the menu system is not available, perhaps
because <a href="http://www.tcl.tk">Tcl/Tk</a> was not
installed, the <a href="S262.htm">Control file</a> can be created
manually</p>

<p><u>Step 1</u> - start the GUI menu system using
<i>\working\hysplit.tcl</i> or the desktop shortcut to
<i>Hysplit</i>. A widget will appear with the <i>HYSPLIT</i>
graphic and three button options: <i>Menu, Help</i> and
<i>Exit</i>.<b>Click on <i>Menu</i> tab<i>.</i></b></p>

<p><u>Step 2</u> - The four main menus of the Hysplit GUI will
appear: <a href="S140.htm">Meteorology</a>,
<a href="S260.htm">Trajectory</a>,
<a href="S360.htm">Concentration</a>, and 
<a href="S440.htm">Advanced</a>.
An additional small widget underneath the main menu gives the
current Hysplit version information. Do not delete this widget as
it will terminate the GUI. It provides the reference frame for the
model's standard output and messages. <b>Click on the
<i>Trajectory</i> tab</b>.</p>

<p><u>Step 3</u> - Five options appear under this item: 
<a href="S210.htm">Setup Run</a>,
<a href="S220.htm">Run Model</a>,
<a href="S230.htm">Display</a>,
<a href="S134.htm">Utilities</a>, and
<a href="S253.htm">Special Runs</a>. 
Normally these are run in sequence, however any item can be selected
and run if the appropriate input files were created during a previous
simulation. <b>Click on the <i>Setup</i> tab</b>.</p>

<p><u>Step 4</u> - <i>Setup Run</i> is used to enter the
basic model simulation parameters: the starting time of the
calculation; starting location in terms of latitude, longitude, and
height; the run-time or duration of the trajectory calculation; and
the names and locations of all required files. When modifications
to this menu are complete, click on <i>Save</i>. However for this
example, you will use the <a href="S211.htm">Retrieve</a> option
for predefined configurations, so do nothing here and <b>go on to
Step 5</b>.</p>

<p><u>Step 5</u> - The example calculation is configured by
<b>clicking on <i>Retrieve</i></b> and then <b><i>entering the
text: sample_traj</i></b>, which is the name of the example
simulation control file that was created for this demonstration.
Then <b>click on <i>OK</i>. A</b>fter the data entry widget is
closed, <b>click on <i>Save</i></b> and the setup menu will
close.</p>

<p><u>Step 6</u> - Click on <a href="S220.htm"><b>Run Model</b></a>, 
which first copies the setup configuration (default_traj) saved in
the previous step, to the model's input <i>CONTROL</i> file. The
model calculation is then started. A series of messages will appear
on standard output text window showing the progress of the calculation.
When the simulation is completed, the trajectory end-points output file
is ready to be converted for graphical display. Under some operating
systems, the standard output widget will not show any output until the
end of the calculation and the <i>Trajectory</i> menu items will be locked
until the calculation completes.</p>

<p>After completion <b>click on Exit</b> to close the window.</p>

<p><u>Step 7</u> - Selecting <a href="S230.htm">Display</a> 
will run a special program that converts the text file of trajectory
<a href="S263.htm">end-point positions</a> into a high quality Postscript
file (<i>trajplot.ps</i>) suitable for printing. The conversion widget
provides options for the frequency of the labels on the trajectory,
a variable zoom factor, and color or black and white graphics options. If
the Postscript viewer (<a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/">Ghostscript</a>)
has been installed and associated with the .ps file suffix, then it will be
invoked by the GUI. If the viewer does not automatically open, it may be 
necessary to manually edit <i>../guicode/hysplit.tcl</i> to change the directory
location associated with the program <i>gsview32.exe</i>. After <b>clicking on
Execute Display</b>, the following graphic will appear in the 
<i>Ghostview</i> window:</p>
