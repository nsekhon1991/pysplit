<p><h2>Meteorology / Help</h2></p>

<p>Meteorological data fields to run the model are usually already
available or can be created from routine analysis archives or
forecast model outputs. More complete descriptions of the different
data sets are available <a href="http://ready.arl.noaa.gov/READYmetdata.php">
on-line</a>. The meteorological data available through the menu system are
summarized in the following sections.</p>

<p>The meteorology menu is divided into four sections: data FTP, data
conversion, data display, and utility programs.</p>
<ul>
<li>The FTP section provides access to various data files that may be FTP'd
from the <a href="S101.htm"> ARL server</a> compatible for immediate input
to HYSPLIT. These files include <a href="S111.htm">current and appended</a>
forecasts as well as various regional and global <a href="S112.htm">
analysis archives</a>. All data files have already been converted for 
HYSPLIT applications.

<li>The convert menu gives data processing options for files that are stored
on the local computer. Processing of forecast or analysis files are available
for archive, forecast, and regional or global data files in various formats.
Processing for GRIB1 formatted input files is available for 
<a href="S125.htm">Global ECMWF/NOAA</a>, and <a href="S126.htm">ERA-40</a>.
NetCDF is supported on UNIX systems permitting conversion of 
<a href="S120.htm">WRF-ARW</a> data files. In addition, a simple interface
has been created to permit the entry of <a href="S128.htm">user generated</a>
time-varying data at a single location. 
 
<li>The display data menu tab provides some simple tools that can
be used to examine the data already in ARL packed format. The most
basic is the <a href="S130.htm">check file</a> listing of the 
individual data records. The <a href="S131.htm">contour map</a>
program will display a contour plot of any variable at any one 
time in the file. Multiple time periods may be processed. The 
<a href="S132.htm">profile program</a> returns a text file of the
profile of meteorological parameters at a pre-selected point. 
The <a href="S133.htm">grid domain</a> menu shows the extent 
of the meteorological grid with a mark at each point.

<li>The utility menu permits <a href="S134.htm">conversion </a>
of Postscript files to any other graphical format and the
creation of <a href="S135.htm">shapfiles</a>.
</ul>

<p>More detailed information about the format of the <a href=
"S141.htm">ARL packed data</a> is available. In addition, various
library routines and <a href="S142.htm">utility programs</a> are
provided to manipulate both the GRIB and ARL packed data files.</p>
