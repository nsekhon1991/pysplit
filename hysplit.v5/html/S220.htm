<p><h2>Trajectory / Run Model</h2></p>

<p>Once the <a href="S210.htm">Trajectory Setup</a> menu has been
closed with the <i>Save</i> button, the changes to the simulation
parameters are copied to <i>default_traj</i>. Clicking on the
<i>Run Model</i> menu tab first copies <i>default_traj</i>
to <i>CONTROL</i> and then runs the trajectory model executable,
<i>hyts_std{.exe}</i>. The executable, by default, attempts to open a
file named <i>CONTROL</i> to read all the required input
parameters. If not found, the model will prompt to standard output
for values from standard input. This condition should not occur
running the model through the GUI. When the model execution starts,
output messages are written to a special window, an example of
which is shown in the illustration below:</p>

<p>Successful completion of a simulation will show a similar
message. Additional run-time diagnostic messages and other error
messages are always written to a file called <i>MESSAGE</i>. This
file may be viewed through one of the <a href="S440.htm">Advanced
Menu</a> tabs. Depending upon the nature of the error message,
perhaps a failure in the model initialization process, error
messages may also appear in above window. Once the model has
completed, <b>press Exit</b> to close the window.</p>
