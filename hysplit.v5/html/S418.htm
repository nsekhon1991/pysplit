<p><h2>Advanced / File Edit / Border Labels</h2></p>

<p>Many of the Postscript graphics programs have label information that can be
customized to some extent. This is accomplished by placing a file called 
<i>LABELS.CFG</i> in the working directory which should contain one or more of
the following valid entries (all in single quotes terminated by &amp;). Replace
the second text string with the new desired text. Not all label strings are valid
with every plotting program. This file can be created and edited through the
menu system. Quotes and string terminators are not required in the edit menu.</p>
<ul>
<li>'TITLE&amp;','NOAA AIR RESOURCES LABORATORY&amp;'
<li>'MAPID&amp;','Air Concentration&amp;'
<li>'LAYER&amp;','Layer Averaged&amp;'
<li>'UNITS&amp;','Bq&amp;'
<li>'VOLUM&amp;','/m3&amp;'
<li>'TZONE&amp;','UTC+00&amp;'
<li>'RELEASE&amp;','Release info&amp;'
<li>'ALLTD&amp;','m&amp;'
</ul>
<p>The time zone variable can be used to force a specific time zone for the air
concentration contour plot. All calculations are performed in UTC, but prior to
plotting, all times are converted by the time zone adjustment. The field should
always be six characters in length. The first three represent the time zone label,
such as UTC, the next character is the sign field (+ to the east or - to the west),
and last two digits are the hours difference of the time zone from UTC.</p> 
<p>Altitude units (ALTTD) may be set to feet for concentration output plots.</p>
