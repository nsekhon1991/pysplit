<p><h2>Advanced / File Edit / Panel Labels</h2></p>

<p>If a file called <i>MAPTEXT.CFG</i> is found in the root or
working directory during the execution of either the trajectory or
concentration plotting program, additional label information is
written at the bottom of each graphic. The <i>Extra Label</i> menu
tab can be used to edit this information. An illustration of the
menu is shown below, followed by the resulting trajectory graphic
for the example simulation. Note that the menu entries are entirely
text based and there are no restrictions regarding content.
However, not all plotting programs display all lines. The example
header text indicates the appropriate application.</p>
