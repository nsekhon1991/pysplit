<p><h2>Meteorology / ARL Data FTP / Set Server</h2></p>

<p>Meteorological data files formatted for use by HYSPLIT are available from
several different FTP servers. The GUI currently supports the definition of
three different servers for forecast and analysis data. The default server
locations and their root data directories are written to the file default_ftp
when the GUI is started for the first time.  The FTP application will only 
search for data at one location as shown in the text box.  One may select
either the default, alternate, or backup sites. Not all data files are 
available at all sites. After selecting a new server, it is only necessary
to exit the GUI and the location in the text box will be used for all 
subsequent FTP commands.</p>

<p>It is possible to edit both the server location and root data directory
and the exiting the GUI will cause subsequent FTPs to use the edited location.
However, if the edits are desired to be saved, then there are two save options.
In the first, Save Changes, just updates the internal array so that the edited
text is saved in either the default, alternate, or backup locations, so that
pressing the radiobutton will bring up the edited locations rather than the
original values for those entries.  In the Save to File option, the changes are
saved to the internal array as well as the default_ftp file, so that when the
GUI is closed and reopened, the new values will be available.</p>
