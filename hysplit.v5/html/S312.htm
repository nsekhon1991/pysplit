<p><h2>Concentration / Setup Run / Pollutant Definition </h2></p>

<p>There are four <i>CONTROL</i> file entries, lines 11(1) through
14(4), that correspond with each line of the pollutant menu shown
in the illustration below.</p>

<center><p><img src="Image23.gif" width="425" height="245"></p></center>

<p>10- <u>Number of different pollutants</u></p>
<ul>
<p>Default: 1</p>
<p>Multiple pollutant species may be defined for emissions. Each
pollutant is assigned to its own particle or puff and therefore may
behave differently due to deposition or other pollutant specific
characteristics. Each will be tracked on its own concentration
grid. The following four entries are repeated for each pollutant
defined.</p>
</ul>

<p>11(1)- <u>Pollutant four Character Identification</u></p>
<ul>
<p>Default: TEST</p>
<p>Provides a four-character label that can be used to identify the
pollutant. The label is written with the concentration output grid
to identify output records associated with that pollutant and will
appear in display labels. Additional user supplied deposition and
chemistry calculations may be keyed to this identification
string.</p>
</ul>

<p>12(2)- <u>Emission rate (per hour)</u></p>
<ul>
<p>Default: 1.0</p>
<p>Mass units released each hour. Units are arbitrary except when
specific chemical transformation subroutines are associated with
the calculation. Output air concentration units will be in the same
units as specified on this line. For instance an input of kg/hr
results in an output of kg/m<sup>3</sup>. When multiple sources are
defined this rate is assigned to all sources unless the optional
parameters are present on line 3(1).</p>
</ul>

<p>13(3)- <u>Hours of emission</u></p>
<ul>
<p>Default: 1.0</p>
<p>The duration of emission may be defined in fractional hours. An
emission duration of less than one time-step will be emitted over
one time-step with a total emission that would yield the requested
rate over the emission duration.</p>
</ul>

<p>14(4)- <u>Release start time: year month day hour minute</u></p>
<ul>
<p>Default: [simulation start]</p>
<p>The previously specified hours of emission start at this time.
An entry of zero's in the field, when input is read from a file,
will also result in the selection of the default values that will
correspond with the starting time of the meteorological data file.
Day and hour are treated as relative to the file start when month
is set to zero.</p>
</ul>

<p><b>Temporal or Area Emission Variations</b></p>

<p>This menu is only designed to input point source emission
rates. Unless additional input values are provided in the control
file after each emission location, the same rate will apply to all
defined point sources for the duration of the emission. When more
complex emission scenarios are required, 
<a href="S441.htm#area_source">emission data</a> can be read in from
a file that defines a diurnal emission cycle for any number of 
pollutants at any number of locations. If the emission rate is to
vary in time beyond one diurnal cycle, there is another
<a href="S441.htm#emit_time">input file</a> that can be
<a href="S417.htm">defined</a> to set a new rate with each emission
cycle. In this latter scenario the rate as well as the location may
be changed.</p>
