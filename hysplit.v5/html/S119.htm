<p><h2>METEOROLOGY / Convert to ARL / NARR Archive</h2></p>

<p>This menu item is intended to convert existing NARR GRIB-1 files
to the ARL packed format. The data files to process are determined
by selecting any file in the GRIB data directory. Subsequent file
names will be constructed automatically between the starting and 
ending day at the hour interval set by the radio-button. Day (DD)
and hour (HH) must be embedded the within the GRIB file name according
to the following NOMADS archive convention: 
narr-a_221_{YYYY}{MM}{DD}_{HH}00_000.grb.
Year (YYYY) and month (MM) are fixed according to the file name'
selected to set the base file name. Time intervals of 12 hours or more
should be avoided in transport and dispersion calculations. Only one
month of data or less should be processed into one output file.</p>

<p>The GRIB files for the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR)
can be downloaded from the 
<a href="http://nomads.ncdc.noaa.gov/data.php?name=access#narr_datasets">
NOMADS</a> web page. When selecting data to download, all variables and 
cycles should be obtained. The simplest approach is to use an FTP client
and go to the directories of the desired data and download all the 
narr-a_221_{YYYY}{MM}{DD}_{HH}00_000.grb files for the desired period.</p> 

<p>
However, the NARR GRIB files are bit mapped, meaning some of the corners
do not have data defined due to differences in the internal grid projection
of the model vesus the output grid. HYSPLIT does not support projections
with a bit map and when running the data converter a message will be
generated:

<br>
<br> WARNING w3fi63: BMS detected in GRIB file
<br> Insure final grid does not intersect BMS
<br> Full domain grid:          349         277
<br> Bitmap reduction:          309         237
<br>
<br>

which indicates the the grid has been slightly reduced to insure that 
all data points within the domain have valid data. The reduced domain
is shown below with the + indicating every 10th data point.
