<p><h2>Concentration / Setup Run / Pollutant, Deposition, Grids</h2></p>

<p>There are three menu choices under this tab: <a href=
"S312.htm">Pollutant</a>, <a href="S313.htm">Grid</a>, and <a href=
"S314.htm">Deposition</a>. The first permits editing of the
emission rate parameters, the second defines the concentration
output grid, and the third the deposition characteristics of the
pollutant, if that feature is enabled. This menu is illustrated
below. To edit the parameters for a specific species entry just
select the appropriate checkbox.</p>

<p>Note that up to 7 pollutant species may be defined by changing
the <i>Num</i> parameter. However, in the current version, the
pollutant and deposition menus must both reference the same number
of species. Multiple species simulations are calculated
independently, hence there is no computational benefit by doing two
different simulations or combining both species in one simulation.
The multiple species option is primarily used for chemical
transformation simulations. A simple example is available from the
<a href="S412.htm">configuration menu</a> checkbox of "10% per
hour", which transforms species #1 to species #2 at a rate of 10%
per hour. The transformation occurs on the same particle and is
discussed in more detail in the <a href="S440.htm">Advanced
Applications</a> section. More complex transformations require a
linkage with compatible external modules. None are available at
this time for public distribution.</p>
