<p><h2>Meteorology / Convert to ARL / WRF-ARW</h2></p>

<p>This menu tab is intended to convert WRF-ARW NetCDF output
files to the ARL packed HYSPLIT compatible format. Input files 
can have any name. The reformatted output files are named by
default to ARWDATA.BIN. The output file can be renamed through
the GUI menu. Multiple time periods from a single file can be 
processed into one output file. However, if single-time multiple
files are to be processed, then each time period should be given
a unique name and then the files can be "cat" or "type" together
into a single file if that is desired. Also note that the HYSPLIT
NetCDF decoder library is not available under Windows and this
program will only work in a UNIX or MAC environment.</p>
