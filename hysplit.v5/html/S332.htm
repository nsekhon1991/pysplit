<p><h2>Concentration / Display / Particle</h2></p>

<p>In addition to the normal display programs for air concentrations, 
which are designed to display and contour the actual values, the 
particle display programs only show the instantaneous positions of the
pollutant particles or puffs that are integrated in time by the model
to produce the air concentration fields. To generate the particle 
position graphics from this menu it is necessary to generate a particle
dump file (default name: PARDUMP), which may contain one or more time
periods of output. The creation of this file is controlled by the
parameters set in the menu tab: "Advanced / Configuration Setup /
<a href="S627.htm">Concentration</a>."</p>

<p>The particle display menu requires the name of the particle position
input file, the base name of the Postscript output file, the type of 
particle display requested, and some additional options. Setting the mass
checkbutton changes the size of the particle display dot according to its
mass, the color option sets the dot color rather than just black. The color
is set according to the height of the particle or if the age value is non-
zero, then the color is set according to the particle age. The GIS option
is (<i>valid only for the horizontal plot</i>) and it will output 
either the ESRI generate format file or a Google Earth KML file.  
If there are too many particles, the density of the display can be 
reduced by plotting only every Nth particle, the default is 1 to display
every particle. The <i>Set Cross</i> button permits the specification of 
the actual cross-section vector, rather than letting the program determine
it automatically. Note that similar to the trajectory and concentration
plotting programs, shapefiles can also be defined for the map background.</p>

<p>The "Plane" option results in the conventional graphic shown below of the
horizonal plane view. There is one black dot for each particle. The size of 
the dot varies according to the pollutant mass assigned to the particle. All
examples are 12 or 24 hours after the start of the test simulation.</p>

<p>The "vertical" option shows an integrated particle distribution view from
the south looking north (top panel) and from the east looking west 
(bottom panel). All particles in the computational domain are shown.</p>

<p>The "cross-section" view is a combination of the horizontal plane and vertical
views. The top panel shows the horizontal particle distribution, while the bottom
panel shows the vertical distribution along the red regression line through the
plume. Again all particles are shown regardless of their distance from the
regression line. The bottom panel view is from left to right in increasing
longitude, regardless of the orientation of the regression line.</p>

<p>The global display is a special program that will always map the particles
on a global equidistant projection. The other programs try to automatically
scale the plots according the to particle distribution, sometimes resulting
in distorted plots when the particle coverage becomes global. There are 
additional command line features in this program (<i>parsplot</i>) for 
particle size and color mapping according to the particle mass that are not
available through the GUI.</p>
