<p><h2>Advanced / Configuration Setup / Mixing Depth Computation Method</h2></p>

<p>Permits the selection of the method used to compute the mixed layer depth.
The mixed layer depth does not affect the trajectory computation, only the 
dispersion and resulting air concentrations by changing the rate of dispersion
as well as providing a lid to vertical mixing of pollutants. Options include
the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use meteorological model - uses the mixed layer depth value from the meteorological
model. Not all model outputs provide mixed layer depths.  Valid field IDs are MXHT,
HPBL, and PBLH.
<li>From temperature profile - computes the height of the mixed layer as the height at
which the potential temperature is at least two degrees greater than the minimum
potential temperature. The computation is made from the top down.
<li>Compute from TKE profile - uses the meteorological model's TKE profile to estimate
the mixing depth at the height at which the TKE either decreases by a factor of two or
falls to a value of less than 0.21. Not all model outputs contain the TKE field.
<li>Compute using a modified Richardson number approach that includes excess temperature 
for convective cases.
<li>Set a constant value (m) - as a last resort the mixing depth can also be set to
a constant value (meters). The <i>kmixd</i> namelist variable either contains the mixing
depth value or the integers 0,1,2 indicating one of the other choices.
</ul>
