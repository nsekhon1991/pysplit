<p><h2>Meteorology / Utilities / Convert Postscript</h2></p>

<p>A utility tab is provided in the meteorology, trajectory, and
concentration menu's that will convert the Postscript graphic to
another format. The menu shows the name of the last Postscript file
that was created. If that is not the file desired, it should be
replaced with the appropriate file name. All output files are
assumed to reside in the working directory and therefore a file
from any menu can be converted from any of the conversion menu
tabs. The file suffix represents the conversion format. The slider
bar determines the size of the output graphic in pixels per inch.
The default value of 70 will produce an output frame of comparable
size to the input graphic. The checkboxes permit the creation of a
multiframe animation in one file or multiple output files if the
"Frames" option has been checked. The "Crop" option eliminates
the white space around the graphic. However, the crop option may produce
inconsistent results when used in conjunction with the animation feature.</p>

<p>The conversion process uses 
<a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/">Ghostscript</a> to read the 
Postscript file and <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</a>
to convert that file to a variety of other supported graphical formats.
These programs can be stand-alone, but they have been linked through the 
<a href="http://www.tcl.tk">Tcl/Tk</a> GUI menu. Conversion to GIF is the 
default. Proper installation of all the previously mentioned 3<sup>rd</sup>
party software is critical in the correct operation of the conversion process.
This software is included with the HYSPLIT trial version but not with the
registered installation executable. Links to these programs are also available
through the HYSPLIT <a href="http://www.arl.noaa.gov/ready/hysp_util.html">
utilities web page</a>.</p>

<p>If non-default directories were selected during the installation of 
<i>Ghostscript</i> and <i>ImageMagick</i>, it may be necessary to
manually edit directory locations. The directory pointers can be changed
from the "Advanced-Configuration-Directories" <a href="S416.htm"> menu</a>
tab, which modifies the file default_exec. In the rare situation when this file
cannot be edited or does not exist because the GUI did not load because of
problems with Tcl/Tk, then the appropriate lines in the upper-level Tcl/Tk file
<i>..\guicode\hysplit.tcl</i> need to be changed. For instance, the lines that
might require editing would be similar to the following:</p>
<ul>
set magick_dir "c:/Program Files (x86)/ImageMagick-6.4.4-Q8/convert.exe"<br>
set gsc_dir "c:/Program Files (x86)/gs/gs8.63/bin/gswin32.exe"<br>
set gsv_dir "c:/Program Files/Ghostgum/gsview/gsview32.exe"<br>
</ul>
