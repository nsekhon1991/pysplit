<p><h2>Concentration / Quick Start Help</h2></p>

<p>Upon installation the first time the model will be configured
to run the example case discussed in more detail below. The "Quick
Start" menu tab can be used to run the example or previous 
simulation in one-step. For more detailed simulation configurations, 
follow the steps below.</p>

<p>The easiest way to run the model is to use the GUI menu to edit
the model's input <i>CONTROL</i> file. For the purposes of this
demonstration appropriate meteorological files are provided. If for
some reason the menu system is not available, the <i>CONTROL</i>
file can be created manually.</p>

<p><u>Step 1</u> - start the GUI menu system using the desktop shortcut
<i>Hysplit</i> to <i>\working\hysplit.tcl</i>. A widget will appear 
with the <i>HYSPLIT</i> graphic and three button options: <i>Menu</i>, 
<i>Help</i> <i>Exit</i>. <b>Click on <i>Menu</i>.</b></p>

<p><u>Step 2</u> - The four main menus of Hysplit will appear: 
<a href="S140.htm">Meteorology</a>, 
<a href="S260.htm">Trajectory</a>,
<a href="S360.htm">Concentration</a>, and the optional 
<a href="S440.htm">Advanced</a> menu. An additional small widget
underneath the main menu gives the current Hysplit version
information. Do not delete this widget as it will terminate the
GUI. It provides the reference frame for the model's standard
output and messages and the version number required for updates. 
<b>Click on <i>Concentration</i>.</b></p>

<p><u>Step 3</u> - Under the concentration menu there are also five
options: <a href="S310.htm">concentration setup</a>,
<a href="S320.htm">run standard model</a>, 
<a href="S330.htm">concentration display</a>, utility programs, and 
<a href="S356.htm">special simulations</a>. In general, they should
be executed in sequential order. <b>Click on <i>Setup Run</i>.</b></p>

<p><u>Step 4</u> - The <i>Setup Run</i> menu brings up similar starting
information requirements as with the <a href="S210.htm">trajectory menu</a>.
There are three additional sub-menus: <a href="S312.htm">Pollutant</a> - 
that can be used set the emission rate, duration, and start time of the
emission; <a href="S313.htm">Grids</a> - to set the location, resolution,
levels, and averaging times of the concentration output grid; and 
<a href="S314.htm">Deposition</a> - to set the characteristics of each
pollutant. <b>Click on <i>Retrieve</i></b>, enter name of sample 
pre-configured control file: <b><i>sample_conc</i></b>, then 
<b>click on <i>OK</i></b>. After the data entry widget is closed, 
<b>click on <i>Save</i></b> and the setup menu will close.</p>

<p><u><a name="run_model"></a>Step 5</u> - From the main
concentration menu tab <b>select</b> <a href="S320.htm">Run
Model</a>, which copies the setup configuration to the model's input 
<i>CONTROL</i> file and starts the model simulation. Messages will 
appear on standard output showing the progress of the calculation or after
the calculation has completed. Be patient as concentration calculations
may take considerably longer than trajectory calculations. 
<b>Click on Exit</b> to close the message window. At that point the binary
concentration output file is ready to be converted to a graphical display.</p>

<p><u><a name="conc_display"></a>Step 6</u> - <b>Click on 
<i>Display / Concentration </i></b> and then <b>select</b> <a href=
"S330.htm">Contours</a> to run a special program that converts the binary 
concentration file to the Postscript file <i>concplot.ps</i>, suitable for
printing. The display widget contains multiple options for different 
pollutants (if defined), data grids, levels, and contour options. These 
are discussed in more detail in the <a href="S330.htm">graphics</a> section. For
this example, accept the defaults and just click <b>on <i>Execute Display</i></b>.
If the <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/">Ghostview</a> Postscript viewer
has been installed and properly associated with .ps files, then it will be 
automatically invoked by the GUI. If the viewer does not open, it may be 
necessary to manually edit the file <i>hysplit.tcl</i> for the directory
entry associated with the program <i>gsview32.exe.</i> The output file can
be printed directly on any Postscript device or printed through
<i>Ghostscript/Ghostview</i>. The 12 hour average air concentration for a 
one hour release is shown in the illustration below.</p>
