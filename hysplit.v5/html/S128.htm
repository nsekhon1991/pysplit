<p><h2>Meteorology / Convert to ARL / User entered </p></h2>

<p>This menu tab is intended to convert user entered meteorological
data to the ARL packed <a href="S141.htm">HYSPLIT compatible</a>
format. The conversion program will create a data file with one or
more time periods containing a uniform field in space and height
but varying in time. The grid is centered over the location
specified in the main menu and covers a 250 by 250 km domain at a horizontal
resolution of 10 km. It is
intended to be used for very short-range simulations. The main menu
permits the selection of an existing text input file (space
delimited format), or the creation of a file through the menu shown
below. After the meteorological data have been entered and saved to
a file, the conversion program is run from the "Run convert" menu
button.</p>

<p>The data entry widget contains five time fields and four data
fields. The output file time interval is computed automatically
from the input data. No interpolation is performed and the input
data nearest in time to the output time are used for the
conversion. The maximum output interval is one hour. Note that the
date-time field defaults to the current system clock time. The
meteorological variables are wind direction, speed (m/s), mixed
layer depth (m), and Pasquill stability category (1=A to 7=G).
After filling in the data for the first line, use the <i>Repeat</i>
button the fill the remaining table entries and then edit the time
and data fields as required.</p>

<p>The conversion program computes the component turbulent velocity
variances based upon the stability category and wind speed and
assumes those values are constant with height within the mixed
layer. Above the mixed layer top the variances are set to the
model's minimum value. Using these data for input the model should
be configured in the <a href="S625.htm">Advanced menu</a> 
to use the variances for the dispersion. Otherwise the diffusion 
calculation will default to the "deformation" method and with a 
spatially constant wind field; the dispersion will always be at 
its minimum value.</p>
