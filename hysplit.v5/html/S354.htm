<p><h2>Concentration / Display / Ensemble / Statistics </h2></p>

<p><b>Summary: </b>This procedure is intended to analyze the binary output
files from any of the ensemble simulations. The output file naming convention
is such that they are defined by the concentration output file name set in the
CONTROL file to which is automatically appended a three digit sequential 
number suffix (.000). The ensemble simulation needs
to be for a case in which experimental data are available for verification. The
script converts the output to the DATEM format, and then calls the statistical
analysis program which appends a statistical summary for each member to a 
single output file.</p>

<p><b>Step 1:</b> defines the <a href="S345.htm">DATEM</a> formatted measured data file 
and unit conversion factor required to convert the HYSPLIT concentration predictions
to the same units as given in the measured data file. 
</p>

<p><b>Step 2:</b> defines name of the statistical output file that will contain
the statistical results for each ensemble member compared with the measured
data values. Normally the <i>statmain</i> program outputs one results file per
execution. In this configuration, a subset of the the complete results for each
member are appended to a single file. The complete statistics are available in file
named <i>stat_000.txt</i>. 
</p>

<p><b>Step 3:</b> runs sequentially through all steps, processing each ensemble member
using <i>c2datem</i> to convert that binary concentration data to the DATEM format, 
and then running <i>statmain</i> to append the results to the statistical output file.
</p>

<p><b>Default file names:</b> The following describes the assigned default input and output
files names for each processing section, so that they can be identified in the working directory.
File names in italics are the ones that can be changed through the menu.</p>

<p>c2datem<ul>
<li>{base name}.{xxx} - binary concentration input file, where xxx = 000 to 999</li>
<li><i>measured.txt</i> - measured data file in DATEM format</li>
<li>hysplit_datem.txt - model prediction output for a member converted to DATEM format</li>
</ul></p>

<p>statmain<ul>
<li><i>measured.txt</i> - measured data input file in DATEM format</li>
<li>hysplit_datem.txt - model prediction input file for a single source from previous step</li>
<li><i>sumstats.txt</i> - statistical summary output appended one record per source location</li>
<li>stat_{xxx}.txt - complete statistics for each member</li>
</ul></p>
