<p><h2>Concentration / Setup Run</h2></p>

<p>The initial setup menu for the concentration model is identical
to the <a href="S210.htm">trajectory setup run</a> menu in terms of
starting time, location, and meteorology. These items will not be
discussed again except to note the differences when applied to a
dispersion simulation. The meaning of the entries in the <i>CONTROL</i>
file that correspond to this setup menu are discussed in more 
<a href="#conc_control1">detail below</a> and should be reviewed to
appreciate how the change in the simulation type (from trajectory
to concentration) changes the meaning and context of the same input
parameters. These parameters consist of the initial entries of the
<i>CONTROL</i> file. The initial concentration setup menu is shown 
in the illustration below.</p>

<p>The entries in the <i>Control</i> file for air concentration
simulations consist of <a href="S311.htm">four groups</a> of input
data. The first data group is almost identical to the trajectory
simulation and is described in the <a href="#conc_control1">next
section</a>. The other three groups define the <a href=
"S312.htm">pollutant emission</a> characteristics, the <a href=
"S313.htm">concentration grid</a> in terms of spacing and
integration interval, and the pollutant characteristics relevant to
computing <a href="S314.htm">deposition and removal</a> processes.
These latter three entries are accessed through the "Pollutant,
Deposition, and Grids Setup" tab. Each of the these sections
contains a more detailed description of the input parameters as
well as the corresponding <i>CONTROL</i> file values that need to
be set for command line simulations.</p>

<p><a name="conc_control1"><b>Initial <i>CONTROL</i> File Section</b></a></p>

<p>The concentration model input control file can be created using
any text editor. However if the GUI is not being used, it would be
easier to let the model create the initial file based upon standard
output prompts. These are described in more detail below. When data
entry is through the keyboard (a file named <i>CONTROL</i> is not
found), a <i>STARTUP</i> file is created. This contains a copy of
the input, and which later may be renamed to <i>Control</i> to
permit direct editing and model execution without data entry. If
you are unsure as to a value required in an input field, just enter
the forward slash (/) character, and the indicated default value
will be used. This default procedure is valid for all input fields
except directory and file names. An automatic default selection
procedure is also available for certain input fields of the
<i>CONTROL</i> file when they are set to zero. Those options are
discussed in more detail below. Each input line is numbered (only
in this text) according to the order it appears in the file. A
number in parenthesis after the line number indicates that there is
an input loop and multiple entry lines may be required depending
upon the value of the previous entry.</p>

<p>1- <u>Enter starting time (year, month, day, hour, (minute, optional))</u>	</p>
<ul>
<p>Default: 0 0 0 0</p>
<p>Enter the two digit values for the UTC time that the calculation
is to start. Use 0's to start at the beginning (or end) of the file
according to the direction of the calculation. All zero values in
this field will force the calculation to use the time of the first
(or last) record of the meteorological data file. In the special
case where year and month are zero, day and hour are treated as
relative to the start or end of the file. For example, the first
record of the meteorological data file usually starts at 0000 UTC.
An entry of "00 00 01 12" would start the calculation 36 hours from
the start of the data file.</p>
The minute field is optional. If the minute
field is not present, then the default value of 0 will be used. </p>
</ul>

<p>2- <u>Number of starting locations</u></p>
<ul>
<p>Default: 1</p>
<p>Single or multiple pollutant sources may be simultaneously
tracked. The emission rate that is specified in the <a href=
"S312.htm">pollutant menu</a> is assigned to each source. If
multiple sources are defined at the same location, the emissions
are distributed vertically in a layer between the current emission
height and the previous source emission height. The effective
source will be a vertical line source between the two heights. When
multiple sources are in different locations, the pollutant is
emitted as a point source from each location at the height
specified. Point and vertical line sources can be mixed in the same
simulation. The GUI menu can accommodate multiple simultaneous
starting locations, the number depending upon the screen resolution. 
Specification of additional locations requires manual editing of the 
<i>CONTROL</i> file. Area source emissions can be specified from an
input file: <i>emission.txt</i>. When this file is present in the root
directory, the emission parameters in the <i>CONTROL</i> file are 
superseded by the emission rates specified in the file. 
More information on this file structure can be found in the 
<a href="S440.htm">advanced help</a> section.</p>
</ul>

<p>3(1)- <u>Enter starting location (lat, lon, meters, Opt-4, Opt-5)</u></p>
<ul>
<p>Default: 40.0 -90.0 50.0</p>
<p>Position in degrees and decimal (West and South are negative).
Height is entered as meters above ground level unless the <a href=
"S412.htm">mean-sea-level flag</a> has been set.</p>
<p>The optional 4<sup>th</sup> (emission rate - units per hour) and
5<sup>th</sup> (emission area - square meters) columns on this
input line can be used to supersede the value of the emission rate
(line 12-2) when multiple sources are defined, otherwise all
sources have the same rate as specified on line 12-2. The
5<sup>th</sup> column defines the virtual size of the source: point
sources default to "0".</p>
</ul>

<p>4- <u>Enter total run time (hours)</u></p>
<ul>
<p>Default: 48</p>
<p>Sets the duration of the calculation in hours. Backward
calculations are configured by setting the run time to a negative
value. See the discussion in the <a href="S440.htm">advanced
help</a> section on backward "dispersion" calculations.</p>
</ul>

<p>5- <u>Vertical motion option (0:data 1:isob 2:isen 3:dens
4:sigma 5:diverg 6:msl2agl 7:average 8:damped)</u></p>
<ul>
<p>Default: 0</p>
<p>Indicates the vertical motion calculation method. The default
"data" selection will use the meteorological model's vertical
velocity fields; other options include isobaric, isentropic,
constant density, constant internal sigma coordinate, computed from
the velocity divergence, a special transformation to correct
the vertical velocities when mapped from quasi-horizontal surfaces 
(such as relative to MSL) to HYSPLIT's internal terrain following sigma
coordinate, and a special option (7) to spatially average the
vertical velocity. The averaging distance is automatically
computed from the ratio of the temporal frequency of the data
to the horizontal grid resolution. </p>
</ul>

<p>6- <u>Top of model domain (internal coordinates m-agl)</u></p>
<ul>
<p>Default: 10000.0</p>
<p>Sets the vertical limit of the internal meteorological grid. If
calculations are not required above a certain level, fewer
meteorological data are processed thus speeding up the computation.
Trajectories will terminate when they reach this level. A secondary
use of this parameter is to set the model's internal scaling height
- the height at which the internal sigma surfaces go flat relative
to terrain. The default internal scaling height is set to 25 km but
it is set to the top of the model domain if the entry exceeds 25
km. Further, when meteorological data are provided on terrain sigma
surfaces it is assumed that the input data were scaled to a height
of 20 km (RAMS) or 34.8 km (COAMPS). If a different height is
required to decode the input data, it should be entered on this
line as the negative of the height. HYSPLIT's internal scaling
height remains at 25 km unless the absolute value of the domain top
exceeds 25 km.</p>
</ul>

<p>7- <u>Number of input data grids</u></p>
<ul>
<p>Default: 1</p>
<p>Number of simultaneous input meteorological files. The following
two entries (directory and name) will be repeated this number of
times. A simulation will terminate when the computation is off all
of the grids in either space or time. Calculations will check the
grid each time step and use the finest resolution input data
available at that location at that time. When multiple
meteorological grids have different resolution, there is an
additional restriction that there should be some overlap between
the grids in time, otherwise it is not possible to transfer a
particle position from one grid to another. If multiple grids are
defined and the model has trouble automatically transferring the
calculation from one grid to another, the sub-grid size may need to
be increased to its <a href="S621.htm">maximum</a> value.<p>
<p> While not available in the GUI, if the user is creating the
CONTROL file themselves, two numbers can be specified here: 
the first being the number of unique grids and the second being
the number of files in each grid. For example, an entry of 2 12
would mean that there are met files for 2 different grids 
(e.g., a regional and a global grid), and that there are 12 files
being specified for each grid. The grids should be specified in 
order of resolution, with the highest resolution grids 
(i.e, the smallest horizontal spacing between grid points)
being specified before lower resolution grids. The two entries
for each file (directory and filename) are repeated for each
file in the first grid, and then for each file in the second grid,
and so on, for any subsequent grids. Note that the same number 
of files are required for each grid in this approach.
Without the use of this approach (i.e., when only one number is
specified) the maximum number of files that can be used in the 
simulation is relatively small, but with this second approach,
a much larger number of files can be used in the simulation.
</p>
</ul>

<p>8(1)- <u>Meteorological data grid # 1 directory</u></p>
<ul>
<p>Default: ( \main\sub\data\ )</p>
<p>Directory location of the meteorological file on the grid
specified. Always terminate with the appropriate slash (\ or
/).</p>
</ul>

<p>9(2)- <u>Meteorological data grid # 1 file name</u></p>
<ul>
<p>Default: file_name</p>
<p>Name of the file containing meteorological data. Located in the
previous directory.</p>
