<p><h2>Concentration / Display / Polar Grids </h2></p>

<p>This menu is used to display concentration fields that were created 
when the concentration grid was defined as a polar grid (radius,distance)
rather than the traditional cartesian latitude-longitude grid. This option
is invoked by setting <a href="S626.htm">CPACK=3</a> in the <i>SETUP.CFG</i>
namelist file. The polar grid is then defined in the
<a href="S313.htm">CONTROL</a> file by the grid spacing and span as the arc
size (latitude values) and the sector distances (longitude values). The 
latitude grid spacing equals the sector angle in degrees and the longitude grid spacing equals the sector distance spacing in kilometers. The latitude
span always equals 360.0 degrees and the longitude span equals the total
downwind distance in kilometers.</p>

<p>The plotting program is called through this menu and provides options
to fill the grid sectors with colors corresponding with the concentration,
or draw contour lines, or output both color fill and contours. The contour
output may also be converted to ESRI generate format for conversion into
shapefiles using the utility convert menu.</p>

<p>Several other options are available through the command line.<br>
<br><b>USAGE: poleplot -[options(default)]</b><br>
-b[background map file name (arlmap)]<br>
-c[concentration data file name (cdump)]<br>
-g[graphics (0)=fill, 1=lines, 2=both]<br>
-l[lat/lon label interval in degrees (0.5)]<br>
-m[maximum concentration value set]<br>
-o[output file name (poleplot.ps)]<br>
-v[vector output (0)=no 1=yes]<br>
