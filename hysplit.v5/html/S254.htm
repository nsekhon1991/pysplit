<p><h2>Trajectory / Special Runs / Daily</h2></p>

<p>This special menu is used for automated trajectory simulations to run
for very long durations: days, weeks, or months. The script will replace
the starting month, day and hour in the CONTROL file with values generated in
the script from the menu shown below. In this example the first model run 
starts at the time set in the CONTROL file: 95 10 16 00.  A new trajectory
calculation will be started every 6 hours for one day. The model output files
are named according to the fields set in the control file and namelist file
menus, but are appended with an eight digit date field. This approach
differs from a single simulation with multiple starting times in that each
simulation is independent and a new output file is created for each run.</p>

<p>The model should be configured and run for the first simulation time
through the standard run menu to insure that the simulation is configured
correctly. If part of the simulation requires meteorological data from the
previous month or the next month, these should be included in the base
simulation test.</p>

<p>As each day's simulation is started, the output file name is written to the
display log. A trajectory is not started at the simulation end time (95 10 17 00).
In this example only four trajectories have been computed, the last of 
which starts at 95 10 16 18.  However, all trajectories have the same duration
of 12 h as the test trajectory example.</p> 

<p>The script in this menu can be used to generate files for input
to the trajectory <a href="S231.htm">frequency</a> analysis program or the 
trajectory <a href="S255.htm">clustering</a> program.</p>
