<p><h2>Concentration / Setup Run / Deposition Definitions</h2></p>

<p>This section is used to define the deposition parameters for
emitted pollutants. The number of deposition definitions must
correspond with the number of pollutants released. There is a
one-to-one correspondence. There are 5 entries in the
<i>CONTROL</i> file for each defined pollutant. The lines 27(1)
through 31(5) correspond with each of the menu items shown in the
illustration below. The radio-buttons along the top can be used to
set default deposition parameters, which can then be edited as
required in the text entry section. The second line of radio-buttons
define the deposition values for some preconfigured species: Cesium,
Iodine (gaseous and particulate), and Tritium. The reset button sets
all deposition parameters back to zero.</p>

<p><font color=red>Note that turning on deposition will result in the 
removal of mass and the corresponding reduction in air concentration,
the deposition will not be available in any output unless height "0" is
defined as one of the concentration grid levels.

<p>26 - <u>Number of pollutants depositing</u></p>
<ul>
<p>Default: number of pollutants on line # 10</p>

<p>Deposition parameters must be defined for each pollutant species
emitted. Each species may behave differently for deposition
calculations. Each will be tracked on its own concentration grid.
The following five lines are repeated for each pollutant defined.
The number here must be identical to the number on line 10.
Deposition is turned off for pollutants by an entry of zero in all
fields.</p>
</ul>

<p>27(1)- <u>Particle: Diameter (&micro;m), Density (g/cc), and Shape</u></p>
<ul>
<p>Default: 0.0 0.0 0.0</p>

<p>These three entries are used to define the pollutant as a
particle for gravitational settling and wet removal calculations. A
value of zero in any field will cause the pollutant to be treated
as a gas. All three fields must be defined (&gt;0) for particle
deposition calculations. However, these values only need to be
correct only if gravitational settling or resistance deposition is
to be computed by the model. Otherwise a nominal value of 1.0 may
be assigned as the default for each entry to define the pollutant
as a particle. If a dry deposition velocity is specified as the
first entry in the next line (28), then that value is used as the
particle settling velocity rather than the value computed from the
particle diameter and density.</p>

<p> If gravitational settling is on and the Shape is set to a
negative value then the Ganser (1993) calculation is used 
to replace Stokes equation for estimating particle fallspeeds.
The absolute value of the Shape factor is used for the calculation.
The Stokes equation overestimates particle fallspeeds for particles 
larger than about 20 micron diameter. As this diameter often lies 
within size distributions of volcanic ash particles, it is desirable 
to use the Ganser formulation so that particle fallspeeds can 
be computed accurately.

<p>The particle definitions can be used in conjunction with a special
namelist parameter <a href="S640.htm">NBPTYP</a> that determines if the
model will just release the above defined particles or create a
continuous particle distribution using the particle definitions as
fixed points within the distribution. This option is only valid if
the model computes the gravitational settling velocity rather than
pre-defining a velocity for each particle size.</p>

</ul>
<p>28(2)- <u>Deposition velocity (m/s), Pollutant molecular weight
(Gram/Mole),</u> <u>Surface Reactivity Ratio, Diffusivity Ratio,
Effective Henry's Constant</u></p>
<ul>
<p>Default: 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0</p>

<p>Dry deposition calculations are performed in the lowest model
layer based upon the relation that the deposition flux equals the
velocity times the ground-level air concentration. This calculation
is available for gases and particles. The dry deposition velocity
can be set directly for each pollutant by entering a non-zero value
in the first field. In the special case where the dry deposition
velocity is set to a value less than zero, the absolute value will be
used to compute gravitational settling <i>but with no mass removal</i>.
The dry deposition velocity can also be calculated by the
model using the resistance method which requires setting the
remaining four parameters (molecular weight, surface reactivity,
diffusivity, and the effective Henry's constant). See the table
below for more information. For particles (partical diameter, density, 
and shape are all nonzero), molecular weight is used as a flag to turn 
on and off the resistance deposition scheme for particles. Setting the 
molecular weight to 1.0 will turn on the resistance deposition scheme 
and setting the molecular weight to 0.0 will turn it off resulting in 
just gravitational settling playing a role in dry deposition.</p>
</ul>

<p>Note that the normal deposition mode is for particles to lose mass to
deposition when those particles are within the deposition layer. Thus
deposition will not decrease the number of computational particles in the model, but
only decrease the amount of mass carried on the particles.
An option to deposit the entire particle's mass
at the surface (the particle is removed) when subjected to deposition is available.
See <a href="S441.htm"> Deposition and Decay </a> for further information.

<p>29(3)- <u>Wet Removal: Actual Henry's constant, In-cloud (GT 1 =L/L; LT 1 =1/s),
Below-cloud (1/s)</u></p>
<ul>
<p>Default: 0.0 0.0 0.0</p>

<p>Suggested: 0.0 8.0E-05 8.0E-05</p>

<p>Henry's constant defines the wet removal process for soluble
gases. It is defined only as a first-order process by a non-zero
value in the field. Wet removal of particles is defined by non-zero
values for the in-cloud and below-cloud parameters. In-cloud removal
can be defined as a ratio of the pollutant in rain (g/liter) measured
at the ground to that in air (g/liter of air in the cloud layer) 
when the value in the field is greater than one. For within-cloud
values less than one, the removal is defined as a time constant.
Below-cloud removal is always defined through a removal time
constant. The default cloud bottom and top RH values can be changed
through the <a href="S640.htm">SETUP.CFG</a> namelist file. Wet
removal only occurs in grid cells with both a non-zero precipitation
value and a defined cloud layer.</p>
</ul>

<p>30(4)- <u>Radioactive decay half-life (days)</u></p>
<ul>
<p>Default: 0.0</p>
<p>A non-zero value in this field initiates the decay process of
both airborne and deposited pollutants. The particle mass decays
as well as the deposition that has been accumulated on the internal
sampling grid. The deposition array (but not air concentration) is 
decayed until the values are written to the output file. Therefore,
the decay is applied only the the end of each output interval. Once
the values are written to the output file, the values are fixed.
The default is to decay deposited material. This can be turned off
so that decay only occurs to the particle mass while airborne by
setting the <i>decay</i> <a href="S640.htm">namelist variable</a>
to zero. </p>
</ul>

<p>31(5)- <u>Pollutant Resuspension (1/m)</u></p>
<ul>
<p>Default: 0.0</p>

<!-- <p>Suggested: 1.0E-06</p> -->

<p>A non-zero value for the re-suspension factor causes deposited
pollutants to be re-emitted based upon soil conditions, wind
velocity, and particle type. Pollutant re-suspension requires the
definition of a deposition grid, as the pollutant is re-emitted
from previously deposited material. Under most circumstances, the
deposition should be accumulated on the grid for the entire
duration of the simulation. Note that the air concentration and
deposition grids may be defined at different temporal and spatial
scales. Note that more computational particles will be generated when using
this option.</p>
