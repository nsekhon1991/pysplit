<p><h2>Concentration / Special Runs / Global </h2></p>

<p>The Global Eulerian Model (GEM) is invoked as a series of subroutines within
the main HYSPLIT transport and dispersion code. Particles or puffs are always first
released in the Lagrangian framework and carried within HYSPLIT until they exceed a
certain age at which point their mass is transferred to the GEM routines. Particles
can be released and transferred for the entire duration of the simulation. The only
requirement is that at one pressure-level global meteorological grid (2.5 degree
reanalysis or 1 degree GFS) needs to be defined for the HYSPLIT calculation.
Additional finer resolution regional meteorological grids can be defined for the
Lagrangian portion of the transport calculation. Details of the global model have
been previously published: Draxler, R.R., 2007, Demonstration of a global modeling
methodology to determine the relative importance of local and long-distance sources,
<i>Atmospheric Environment</i>, 41:776-789, doi:10.1016/j.atmosenv.2006.08.052.</p>

<p><b>General Instructions</b></p>

<p>Although the HYSPLIT-GEM version has its own executable, without the required
namelist file <i>GEMPARM.CFG</i> the calculation will proceed as a standard 
Lagrangian HYSPLIT simulation. In this situation, the model will write the default
file <i>gemparm.bak</i> as a reminder that a GEM configuration file is required to
invoke the global subroutines. This file can then be edited and renamed if not 
using the GUI interface. GEM and HYSPLIT each create their own concentration output
files and if the total concentration is required, the results from the two 
calculations must be added together. The program <i>concadd</i> is included in the
distribution and can be accessed from the <a href="S338.htm"> global display</a> menu
by selecting the plume add checkbox. Furthermore, the GEM concentration grid is
always a snapshot concentration. There is no averaging option. In general, the model
simulation is configured like any other HYSPLIT simulation, through the <i>CONTROL</i>
and <i>SETUP.CFG</i> files.  Additional GEM specific options are set in the 
<i>GEMPARM.CFG</i> file. Not all GEM options are available through the GUI and can
only be modified by editing the file directly.</p>

<p><b>SETUP.CFG Namelist Configuration</b></p>

<p>There is only one parameter in the HYSPLIT namelist that is required for the
GEM subroutines:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set GEMAGE (default=48 hours) for the time a particle or puff is transferred to
global model. Note that when GEMAGE<0, the particles switch to the GEM grid when the particle
meteorology grid switches to global meteorological grid or when the particle age=|gemage|.
<li>When using an <i>EMITIMES</i> file, QCYCLE is not used for emission cycling. Also if
the <i>EMITIMES</i> file has fewer sources than defined in the <i>CONTROL</i> file, the
emissions specified in the <i>CONTROL</i> file need to be set correctly and match the
first value in <i>EMITIMES</i>.
</ol>

<p><b>GEMPARM.CFG GUI Namelist Options </b></p>

<p>Only a subset of the namelist options are available to be set through the GUI. Note
that concentration (mass/m3) output will always be written to <i>gemconc.bin</i> as individual
or averaged layers, but the integrated output (mass/m2) will only be written to <i>gemzint.bin</i>.
The bottom and top values are given as index numbers where 1 is the bottom layer. Layer thickness 
corresponds with the input meteorological data and cannot be modified. The GUI interface is shown
below:</p>
