<p><h3>Emission Cycling</h3></p>

<p><i>QCYCLE</i> (0.0) are the number of hours between emission start cycles.
A zero value means that the emissions are not cycled. When non-zero, the number
of emission hours is repeated again at <i>QCYCLE</i> hours after the starting
emission time specified in the input <i>CONTROL</i> file. The <i>NUMPAR</i>
parameter set in the release number limits menu is defined as the number of
particles released over the emission duration per cycle unless its value is
less than zero, in that case it defines the hourly particle number release
rate directly as <i>|NUMPAR|</i>. The <i>QCYCLE</i> parameter is also used
in conjunction with namelist option <a href="S628.htm">ICHEM=10</a> to that
the concentrations from each release cycle are saved in their own 
concentration array.</p>

<p><h3>Optional Point-Source Emission File</h3></p>

<p><i>EFILE</i> (undefined) is the file name that contains point-source temporal
emission factors, where each record contains the {year month day hour duration
latitude longitude emission-rate} for each emission period. Multiple emission
periods can be defined. The values in this file replace the values set in the
<i>CONTROL</i> file. The emission file can be created from the <a href="S417.htm">
Advanced Menu</a> tab. The format of this file is more complex than the one
used to multiply <a href="S640.htm">time-varying</a> unit-source dispersion
factors created by the <i>ICHEM=10</i> option described above.</p>
