<p><h2>Concentration / Run Model</h2></p>

<p>Once the Concentration Setup menu has been closed with the
<i>Save</i> button, the changes to the simulation parameters are
copied to <i>default_conc</i>. Clicking on the <i>Run Standard
Mode</i>l menu tab first copies <i>default_conc</i> to
<i>CONTROL</i> and then runs the trajectory model executable,
<i>hycs_std</i>. The executable, by default, attempts to open a
file named <i>CONTROL</i> to read all the required input
parameters. If not found, the model will prompt to standard output
for values from standard input. This condition should not occur
running the model through the GUI.</p>

<p>In the situation where the namelist file <i>SETUP.CFG</i> has
been created through the <i>Advanced/Configuration</i> menu tab,
the message shown below will appear. If the intent was to run using
this file, then continue, otherwise one can delete the file and run,
or terminate the simulation. The situation may arise that the
namelist file was created for a previous simulation and is not needed
this time.</p>

<p>When the model execution starts, output messages are written
to a special window. Successful completion of a simulation will
show a message similar to the example shown in the illustration
below:</p>

<p> Additional run-time diagnostic messages and other
error messages are always written to a file called <i>MESSAGE</i>.
This file may be viewed through one of the Advanced Menu tabs.
Depending upon the nature of the error message, perhaps a failure
in the model initialization process, error messages may also appear
in above window. Once the model has completed, <b>press Exit</b> to
close the window.</p>

<p> Sometimes a configuration (long duration, very fine grid, too many particles)
will lead to extremely long run times, perhaps requiring the model to be
terminated prematurely. Closing the GUI will not terminate the simulation because it
always runs in background. In this situation it is necessary to use the
<i>cntl-alt-del</i> key combination (Windows) to find and kill the <i>hycs_std</i>
executable.</p>
