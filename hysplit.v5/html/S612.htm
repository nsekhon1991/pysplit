<p><h2>Advanced / Configuration Setup / Multiple Trajectories in Time</h2></p>

<p>Restart Interval - <i>NSTR</i> (0) - Hours between trajectory starts for
multiple trajectory-in-time simulations. When greater than zero, new
trajectories will be started from the original starting location
every NSTR hours from the initial trajectory starting time. See the
<a href="S253.htm#multi_time">special trajectory</a> simulation
section for more information.</p>

<p>Number of Multiple Levels - <i>NVER</i> (0) - Number of vertical levels 
that trajectories are restarted when trajectories for multiple
trajectory-in-time-and-space simulations. When greater than zero,
new trajectories will be started at this number of levels from the
endpoint position at the NSTR interval. The level heights are set
in the CONTROL file and must match the number of starting
locations. See the <a href="S253.htm#multi_space">special
trajectory</a> simulation section for more information.</p>

<p>Trajectory Duration - <i>MHRS</i> (9999) - Sets the maximum temporal trajectory
restart period. For instance if you want to compute one month's worth of
two-day trajectories, then the run duration would be 720 hours,
<i>MHRS</i> would be set to 672 hours (720-48), and <i>KHMAX</i>
<a href="S613.htm">(see below)</a> would be set to 48 hours.</p>
