<p><h2>Concentration / Setup Run / Grid Definition</h2></p>

<p>This section is used to define the grid system to which the
concentrations are summed during the integration and subsequently
for post-processing and display of the model's output. There are 10
entries in the CONTROL file for each concentration grid that has
been defined. The lines 16(1) through 25(10) correspond with each
of the menu items shown in the illustration below.</p>

<p>Dispersion calculations are performed on the computational
(meteorological) grid without regard to the definition or location
of any concentration grid. Therefore it is possible to complete a
simulation and have no results to view if the concentration grid
was in the wrong location. In addition, very small concentration
grid spacing will reduce the model's integration time step and may
result is substantially longer simulation clock times.</p>

<p>15- <u>Number of simultaneous concentration grids</u></p>
<ul>
<p>Default: 1</p>
<p>Multiple or nested grids may be defined. The concentration
output grids are treated independently. The following 10 entries
will be repeated for each grid defined.</p>

<p>In the special case with the first grid heights above
ground level and the second grid heights above mean sea level,
this value is set to negative 2, and the MSL flag is <u>not</u> set.
Similarly if this value is set to negative 4, the first and third grids 
are referenced to ground level, the second and fourth to mean sea level.  
(See section "Height of each level" below.)</p>
</ul>

<p>16(1)- <u>Center Latitude, Longitude (degrees)</u></p>
<ul>
<p>Default: [source location]</p>
<p>Sets the center position of the concentration sampling grid in
degrees and decimal. Input of zero's will result in selection of
the default value, the location of the emission source. Sometimes
it may be desirable to move the grid center location downwind near
the center of the projected plume position.</p>
</ul>

<p>17(2)- <u>Grid spacing (degrees) Latitude, Longitude</u></p>
<ul>
<p>Default: 1.0 1.0</p>
<p>Sets the interval in degrees between nodes of the sampling grid.
Puffs must pass over a node to contribute concentration to that
point and therefore if the spacing is too wide, they may pass
between intersection points. Particle model calculations represent
grid-cell averages, where each cell is centered on a node position,
with its dimensions equal to the grid spacing. Finer resolution
concentration grids require correspondingly finer integration
time-steps. This may be mitigated to some extent by limiting fine
resolution grids to only the first few hours of the simulation.</p>

<p>In the special case of a polar (arc,distance) concentration grid,
defined when the namelist variable <a href="S626.htm">cpack=3</a>, the 
definition changes such that the latitude grid spacing equals the 
sector angle in degrees and the longitude grid spacing equals the 
sector distance spacing in kilometers.</p>
</ul>

<p>18(3)- <u>Grid span (deg) Latitude, Longitude</u></p>
<ul>
<p>Default: [180.0] [360.0]</p>
<p>Sets the total span of the grid in each direction. For instance,
a span of 10 degrees would cover 5 degrees on each side of the
center grid location. A plume that goes off the grid would have
cutoff appearance, which can sometimes be mitigated by moving the
grid center further downwind.</p>

<p>Grid span and spacing should be set according to the scale of the run.  
Small scale runs can have fine spacing and small span; the opposite for
large scale runs.  </p>

<p>In the special case of a polar (arc,distance) concentration grid,
defined when the namelist variable <a href="S626.htm">cpack=3</a>, 
the definition changes such that the latitude span always equals 
360.0 degrees and the longitude span equals the total downwind 
distance in kilometers. Note that the number of grid points equals 
360/arc-angle or the total-distance divided by the sector-distance.</p>
</ul>

<p>19(4)- <u>Enter grid # 1 directory</u></p>
<ul>
<p>Default: ( \main\sub\output\ )</p>
<p>Directory to which the binary concentration output file for this
grid is written. As in other directory entries a terminating (\)
slash is required.</p>
</ul>

<p>20(5)- <u>Enter grid # 1 file name</u></p>
<ul>
<p>Default: file_name</p>
<p>Name of the concentration output file for each grid. See Section
6 for a description of the format of the concentration output
file.</p>
</ul>

<p>21(6)- <u>Number of vertical concentration levels</u></p>
<ul>
<p>Default: 1</p>
<p>The number of vertical levels in the concentration grid
including the ground surface level if deposition output is
required.</p>
</ul>

<p>22(7)- <u>Height of each level (m)</u></p>
<ul>
<p>Default: 50</p>
<p>Output grid levels may be defined in any order for the puff
model as long as the deposition level (0) comes first (a height of
zero indicates deposition output). Air concentrations must have a
non-zero height defined. A height for the puff model indicates the
concentration at that level. A height for the particle model
indicates the average concentration between that level and the
previous level (or the ground for the first level). Therefore
heights for the particle model need to be defined in ascending
order. Note that the default is to treat the levels as
above-ground-level (AGL) unless the MSL (above Mean-Sea-Level) flag
has been set (see <a href="S412.htm">advanced configuration</a>).</p>
</ul>

<p>23(8)- <u>Sampling start time: year month day hour minute</u></p>
<ul>
<p>Default: [simulation start]</p>
<p>Each concentration grid may have a different starting, stopping,
and output averaging time. Zero entry will result in setting the
default values. Default values are to use the simulation starting time (1). 
"Backward" calculations require that the stop time
should come before the start time.</p>

<p>If the month field is zero, then the minute and hour fields in the sample
start will be used to set the sample start time relative to the simulation start time (1).<br>
For example, if the simulation starting time is 18 10 31 05 and the sample start is set
at 00 00 00 02 00 then the sample start time will be at 18 10 31 07 00.</p>

Warning: The adjustable time step feature (DELT=0 in SETUP.CFG) should only be used
when the sampling start time minute field is zero.
If the minute field is non-zero, then the time step should be set to be
a factor of the minute field. (For example, if you are setting the sampling start to be
30 minutes past the hour, you could set DELT to be 30, 15, 10, 6, 5, 3, 2 or 1.)
This needs to be done to ensure that the time HYSPLIT begins the sampling
period lines up with the start of a new time step.</p>


</ul>

<p>24(9)- <u>Sampling stop time: year month day hour minute</u></p>
<ul>
<p>Default: [One year from simulation starting time]</p>
<p>After this time no more concentration records are written. Early
termination on a high resolution grid (after the plume has moved
away from the source) is an effective way of speeding up the
computation for high resolution output near the source because once
turned-off that particular grid resolution is no longer used for
time-step computations.</p>

<p>Zero entry (00 00 00 00 00) results in setting the default values.
Default values are one
year from the simulation starting time (1). 
(Or one year before the simulation start in the
case of backward runs) </p>

<p>If the month field is zero, then the minute and hour fields in the sample
stop will be used to set the sample stop time relative to the sample start time (23(8)).
<br> This was implemented in V985. <br>
For example, if the sample start is set to 18 10 31 07 00 and the sample stop
is 00 00 00 05 00 then the sample stop will be set to 18 10 31 12 00.
</p>

</ul>

<p>25(10)- <u>Sampling interval: type hour minute</u></p>
<ul>
<p>Default: 0 24 0</p>
<p>Each grid may have its own sampling or averaging interval. The
interval can be of three different types: averaging (type=0),
snapshot (type=1), or maximum (type=2). Averaging will produce output
averaged over the specified interval. For instance, you may want to
define a concentration grid that produces 24-hour average air
concentrations for the duration of the simulation, which in the case
of a 2-day simulation will result in 2 output maps, one for each day.
Each defined grid can have a different output type and interval. 
Snapshot (or now) will give the instantaneous output at the output
interval, and maximum will save the maximum concentration at each grid
point over the duration of the output interval. Therefore, when a maximum
concentration grid is defined, it is also required to define an identical
snapshot or average grid over which the maximum will be computed. There
is also the special case when the type value is less than zero. In that
case the value represents the averaging time in hours and the output
interval time represents the interval at which the average concentration
is output. For instance, a setting of {-1 6 0} would output a one-hour
average concentration every six hours.</p>
