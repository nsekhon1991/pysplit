<p><h2>Concentration / Utilities / Convert to Dose</h2></p>

<p>
Converts a HYSPLIT binary concentration and deposition file to dose in rem/hr. The 
HYSPLIT calculation should be done using a unit emission so that the concentration
units are m<sup>-3</sup> and the deposition units are m<sup>-2</sup>.
This post-processing step reads the
file activity.txt which contains the activity (Bq) at time=0 for all the isotope
products. Sample activity.txt files can be created by the program for a high-energy
nuclear detonation or a thermal fission reaction from a power plant reactor.
The file also contains the half-life and cloud- and ground-shine does conversion
factors for each radionuclide specified in the file.</p>

<p>
For nuclear detonations, the activity.txt file contains columns for either a 
high-energy or thermal fission reaction assuming a yield of 1 kT. The emission 
factor can be specified as a multiple of 1 kT. Activation products resulting from 
the fission are not considered. Two fuel sources (U235 and Pu239) are available for 
each reaction type. The fission yield data were obtained from T.R. England
and B.F. Rider, Los Alamos National Laboratory, LA-UR-94-3106; ENDF-349 (1993). The
external dose rate for cloud- and ground-shine is computed from the factors given by
Eckerman K.F. and Leggett R.W. (1996) DCFPAK: Dose coefficient data file package for
Sandia National Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory Report ORNL/TM-13347.</p>

<p>
During the processing step, the cumulative product of the activity and dose factor
is computed for each decay weighted concentration averaging period, independently 
for noble gases and particles. Command line options exist to turn off the dose
calculation but still multiplying the dispersion factors by the activity, resulting
in air concentration output. If the dispersion factors input file contains only
one pollutant type and level, then an option can be set to output each of the species
defined in the activity.txt file. Concentration units may also be converted from
Bq to pCi.</p>

<p>
For nuclear power plant accidents, the same fission product table can be used by
entering the duration of the reactor operation in terms of mega-watt-hours based upon 
the relation that 3000 MW-hours releases an energy equivalent to 2.58 kT. An
alternative approach is to generate an activity.txt file that corresponds with the
radionuclide release profile of the reactor accident. The command line option
-afdnpp will create a sample activity.txt file that corresponds to the maximum
emissions over a 3-hour period during the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant
accident for the 10 most critical radionuclides for short-term dose calculations. </p>

<p>
Post Processing Program <i>CON2REM</i> command line options (default):
<ul>
<li> -a[activity data file name (activity.txt) or {create|fdnpp}]
<p>Names the input file describing activity associated with each species and the dose
conversion factors. The -acreate option will create a sample activity.txt file
for a 1kT detonation with just a few species to illustrate the format. The -afdnpp
option will create a file with the top ten radionuclides contributing to dose
during the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident.</p>

<li> -b[breathing rate for inhalation dose in m3/h (0.925)
<p>
The breathing rate is used as a multiplier for the calculation of the inhalation 
dose factor. This is only used for the cloudshine dose calculations.</p>

<li> -c[Output type: (0)-dose, 1-air conc/dep]<br>
<img src="Image82C.gif" width="407" height="55">
<p>If the flag is set to one, the dose conversion factors are set to one and the output
will be concentration,the product of the input air concentration (from a unit emission)
times the activity for each radionuclide defined in activity.txt. The values are  summed 
for all species in each pollutant class (NGAS or RNUC).</p>

<li> -d[Type of dose: (0)=rate (R/hr) 1=summed over the averging period (R)]<br>
<img src="Image82D.gif" width="258" height="56">
<p>When computing dose, the option is to output a rate or the total dose accumulated over
each concentration averaging period. Note that dose from deposition is always summed
over the duration of the simulation.</p>

<li> -e[include the inhalation dose in the calculation (0)=No 1=Yes]'
<p>This is used in conjunction with the -b option. The default is not to include the
inhalation dose as part of the cloudshine calculation. If this is turned on, insure that
the inhalation dose factors are correctly defined in the last column of activity.txt.</p>

<li> -f[fuel (1)=U235 2=P239]<br>
<img src="Image82A.gif" width="381" height="167">
<p>This flag selects which column of the activity.txt file will be used to determine the
emission amount. The first two columns are for U-235 fission and the last two columns are
for Pu-239 fission. There are columns for high-energy or thermal fission (see -p flag).
Also see the -y and -w flags to scale the emissions to the event.</p>

<li> -g[decay type: 0=normal {c=1}, (1)=time averaged decay]
<p>Prior to computing the dose, the activity is time-decayed to either the end of the
sampling time (0=normal) or as the time averaged activity between the start and end time
of each sampling period (1=time-averaged, the default). Normal decay can only be applied
to air concentration calculations. Dose output always requires time-averaged decay.</p>

<li> -h[help with extended comments]
<p>Provides a short narrative of the functionality of this program with a list of all the
command line options.</p>

<li> -i[input file name (cdump)]
<p>The name of the HYSPLIT air concentration/deposition binary output file. The simulation
can contain both air concentrations and deposition field. Proper conversion of the model output
fields to dose requires a unit release rate in the HYSPLIT calculation.</p>

<li> -n[noble gas 4-char ID (NGAS)]
<p>The program searches for this pollutant 4-character identification to use as the dispersion
factor for noble gases. All other ID values (RNUC, etc) are assumed to be for particles. All
species will be summed to either the NGAS or the other dispersion factor unless species matching
is defined (-s1).</p>

<li> -o[output file name (rdump)] 
<p>The output file will contain the same number of levels and time periods as the input file
but with the dispersion factors (unit concentrations) converted to dose or species concentration
according to the settings of the other command line options.</p>

<li> -p[process (1)=high-energy 2=thermal]
<p>Defines which column of the activity.txt file to use for a specific fuel type. Option 1 is 
for high-energy fission (columns 1 or 3) and option 2 is for thermal fission (columns 2 or 4).
In the case of the FDNPP activity.txt file, the activity values are the same in all columns.
This feature may be used with customized activity.txt files to select different source options.
Also see the -f flag for selection the fuel type.</p>

<li> -q[convert dose from rem=0 to sieverts=(1)]<br>
<img src="Image82D.gif" width="258" height="56">
<p>The default dose output is in REM because the conversion factors are defined in the activity.txt
file in REM/Bq. Setting this value to one converts the dose output from REM to Sieverts
(100 REM = 1 Sievert).</p>

<li> -s[(0)=sum species, 1=match to input, 2=output species]<br>
<img src="Image82C.gif" width="407" height="55">
<p>The default value (0) sums each species in the the activity.txt file to its corresponding
pollutant class (NGAS - noble gas, or RNUC -  radionuclide particle). The match to input option (1)
just does a one-to-one match of the pollutant ID in the activity.txt file with the pollutant IDs
used in the simulation. Pollutant IDs can be 4-digit integer number or character for option (1). In
option (2), the output file can be expanded to include a concentration for each species defined in
the activity.txt file using the dispersion factors from its pollutant class from the simulation.
In this configuration, HYSPLIT can only be run with one level and species.<br>
</p>

<li> -t[0=no decay input decayed, or decay by species half-life (1)]
<p>The default (1) is for all species to be decayed to the valid time of the concentration output
from the start time of the simulation which is assumed to be the time fission ceased. The time of
release to the atmosphere can occur much later. The no decay option is only required when decay
has already been applied in the dispersion calculation. In general, decay should only be set in
the dispersion calculation for short-duration releases which coincide with the termination of
fission, otherwise decay may be computed incorrectly. Computing decay within this post-processing
step is the most accurate way to approach dose simulations.</p>

<li> -u[units conversion Bq->pCi, missing: assume input Bq]
<p>When air concentration output is selected, then the output units can be converted from Bq to pCi.</p>

<li> -w[Fission activity in thermal mega-watt-hours, replaces the -y option value]
<p>If the activity.txt file represents the number of fissions per kT, and the -w field is non-zero, 
then the activity is computed with respect to the number of MWh generating the fission products. 
The assumption is that a 3000 MW reactor creates about 2.58 kT per hour of fission products.</p>

<li> -x[extended decay time in hours beyond calculation (0)]
<p>Additional decay time can be added using this field to estimate long-term doses. This calculation
applies to either -t option but only for deposition doses. This option permits longer-term doses to be
computed by adding additional decay to the existing output files.</p>

<li> -y[yield (1.0)=kT]<br>
<img src="Image82B.gif" width="234" height="135">
<p>The default assumes that the activity levels defined in activity.txt represent the emissions
from a 1 kT device. Other values are computed as a multiplier to the values defined in the table.
The multiplier can be used in the context of a detonation in terms of kT or a multiple of the
3-hour emission maximum from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident.</p>

<li> -z[fixed decay time in hours (0)]'
<p>The fixed decay is computed to the end of the sample time in the output file regardless of the
actual simulation or release start time. All output periods, regardless of sampling time, will be 
decayed for these number of hours.</p>

<p>
As an example, a HYSPLIT simulation could be configured with two species, NGAS for the noble gases and
RNUC for the radio-nuclide particles. After the emissions stop, the total emissions of both NGAS and
RNUC should equal one. Then in the post-processing step, <i>con2rem</i> is called and the concentration
and deposition fields are multiplied by the total emission and dose conversion factor for each species and
added together to get a ground-shine and cloud-shine dose file, which can then be plotted using any of 
the standard HYSPLIT display programs. Dose results, by species, are decayed to the valid time of the
output graphic. An additional time factor can be added for long-term dose estimates.</p>

<p> One aspect of applying the decay in the the post-processing step is that the decay times are 
referenced to the start of the simulation rather than the start of the release. This means that the
radionuclide release rate is valid at the start of the simulation time. This might be the best 
configuration for a nuclear power plant accident, where the fission is assumed to have stopped
at the start of the release (and simulation).  However in other situations, where emissions might
be occurring in concert with some other process, then starting the decay at the time when the
radionuclides are released might be a more appropriate configuration. If the decay is computed
during the model calculation for each species released then use the <i>con2rem</i> 
options -s1 -t0 to apply just the emission factors and not decay in the post-processing step.</p>
