<p><h2>Concentration / Display / Source-Receptor / Stats </h2></p>

<p><b>Summary: </b>This procedure is intended to find the source location that
provides the best fit with measurement data. After running HYSPLIT with the
<a href="S356.htm">matrix</a> option and <a href="S628.htm">ICHEM=1</a>, the script
extracts each source location from the CONTROL file, converts the output to
the DATEM format, and then calls the statistical analysis program which is
converted to a gridded binary file which can be plotted by any of the
standard concentration plotting programs.

<p><b>Step 1:</b> defines the <a href="S345.htm">DATEM</a> formatted measured data file 
and unit conversion factor required to convert the HYSPLIT concentration predictions
to the same units as given in the measured data file. 
</p>

<p><b>Step 2:</b> defines name of the statistical output file that will contain
the statistical results from each source location compared with the measured
data values. Normally the <i>statmain</i> program outputs one results file per
execution. In this configuration, the results form each source location are 
appended to a single file, one record per source. 
</p>

<p><b>Step 3:</b> defines the root name of the final output graphics file which will
show a plot of the statistical results by source location. The <i>.ps</i> suffix is
created by default. 
</p>

<p><b>Step 4:</b> runs sequentially through all steps of the process, reading each source
location from the <i>CONTROL</i> file, running <i>matrix</i> to extract that location from the 
HYSPLIT simulation output file, using <i>c2datem</i> to convert that binary extract to the
DATEM format, and then running <i>statmain</i> to append the results to the statistical
output file. <font color=green>This step needs only to be run once.</font>
</p>

<p><b>Step 5:</b> defines which <a href="S500.htm">statistic</a> will be shown: 
Corr - correlation coefficient, NMSE - normalized mean square error, FB - fractional bias, 
FMS - figure of merit in space, KSP - Kolmogorov Smirnoff parameter, and finally the rank, 
which is a combination of the previous parameters. Once all source locations have been processed, 
the statistical file is read and converted to binary gridded format using <i>stat2grid</i>. This 
output file can then be plotted with any of the display programs such as <i>gridplot</i>.
</p>

<p><b>Default file names:</b> The following describes the assigned default input and output
files names for each processing section, so that they can be identified in the working directory.
File names in italics are the ones that can be changed through the menu.</p>

<p>matrix<ul>
<li><i>cdump</i> - binary outfile from a single multi-source simulation using the ICHEM=1 option</li>
<li>SRM_cdump - binary concentration output file extracted for one source location</li>
</ul></p>

<p>c2datem<ul>
<li>SRM_cdump - binary concentration input file from the previous step</li>
<li><i>measured.txt</i> - measured data file in DATEM format</li>
<li>hysplit_datem.txt - model prediction output for a single source converted to DATEM format</li>
</ul></p>

<p>statmain<ul>
<li><i>measured.txt</i> - measured data input file in DATEM format</li>
<li>hysplit_datem.txt - model prediction input file for a single source from previous step</li>
