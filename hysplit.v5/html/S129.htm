<p><h2>Meteorology / Convert to ARL / MCIP IOAPI</h2></p>

<p>This menu calls a utility program to convert meteorological
data files created by <a href="http://www.cmascenter.org"> MCIP</a>
for the CMAQ model. The data files follow a specific naming
convention and may contain multiple variables and time periods.  
They are in the <a href="http://www.baronams.com/products/ioapi">
IOAPI</a> format. The conversion program is currently only 
available on UNIX or LINUX systems and will convert all the
required fields in one pass for all available time periods.
The data from multiple input files, say each file contains
one day, may be appended automatically by setting the append
file name to a non-null string. If there are time period
overlaps between input files, it is best not to append them,
but to select multiple input files when running HYSPLIT.</p>

<p>There are three required MCIP input meteorological data files: 
METCRO3D_, METDOT3D_, METCRO2D_, and one file, GRIDDOT2D_ that
gives the grid information. All data values are interpolated
to the dot grid. In the GUI, only one input file needs to be selected
and the conversion program uses the file suffix and the standard
naming convention to determine the names of the other files to open.
Due to file name character length restrictions, the directory
information is removed and all the input files should be in the 
local working directory.</p>
