<p><h2>Meteorology / Convert to ARL / Global Lat-Lon</h2></p>

<p>This menu tab is intended to <a href=
"S142.htm#grib2arl">convert</a> existing ECMWF or NOAA GRIB-1 files
to the ARL packed <a href="S141.htm">HYSPLIT compatible</a> format.
Subsequent file names will be constructed automatically between the
starting and ending day at the hour interval set by the
radio-button. Day and hour are assumed to be the last four digits
of the file name: {base}{DD}{HH}. Input files could consist of
multiple time period forecasts or single-time period archives. Time
intervals of 12 hours or more should be avoided in transport and
dispersion calculations. Only one month of data or less should be
processed into one output file. HYSPLIT cannot properly position to
the correct starting data record if there is a month transition
included within a data file.</p>

<p>The input data may be on pressure surfaces or the native
hybrid coordinate system. The "number of levels", counted from the
surface upwards, can be used to restrict the size of the output
file. This may be particularly useful when the input file consists
of 60 or more hybrid levels.</p>

<p>Four different grid conversions are available through the menu.
The "Extract" option interpolates the data to a conformal map
projection of 100x100 grid points at 100 km resolution at the
center of the latitude and longitude selection of the slider bar.
The Northern- or Southern Hemisphere options create a 95-km
resolution polar stereo-graphic grid centered about the pole. The
"Input" option results in no interpolation and the program just
converts the original latitude-longitude data (global or regional)
to the ARL packed format.</p>

<p>The conversions from this menu are intended for data sets created
by the operational ECMWF or NOAA forecast models. These may be
forecast or analysis data. Conversion of <a href="S126.htm">ECMWF
reanalysis</a> data is done through a different menu.</p>
