<p><h2>Meteorology / Display data / Contour Map</h2></p>

<p>The contour display program, run from this menu, provides a
simple tool to create a contour map for any variable at any time
period in any ARL packed format meteorological data file. A simple
configuration is available through the menu shown below. More
options are available if the program is run through the command
line.</p>

<p>In the example shown above, the sample
meteorological data file has been selected to display the
temperature (TEMP) variable on model level #2. The time period to
be shown is offset 24 hours from the first time period in the file.
No additional time periods are shown when the increment is set to
zero. The map will be centered about 40N 90W with a radius of 20
degrees latitude. The maximum contour value and the temperature
difference (Delta) between contours will be determined
automatically (-1.0). The radiobuttton default is to draw contour
lines on top of the color fill.</p>

<p>For a latitude-longitude grid, the full grid cannot be plotted.  
Instead a sub-grid not centered at 0 deg latitude, 0 deg longitude
must be set.</p>

<p>There are two additional derived display options available.
Selecting the variable "VECT" will produce a wind vector plot and
selecting "DIVG" will produce a plot of the wind field divergence.
Both of these options require the U and V velocity fields at the
selected level in the order of U followed by V.</p>

<p>The radio buttons show only the most common set of variables
found in the meteorological data files. The menu does not know which
variables are available in the selected file. The check file program
can be used to examine the variables contained in each file. The variable
selected for display using the radio-button may be superseded by 
replacing the text entry with the desired variable identification.</p>

<p>The output file <i>contour.ps</i> is created in Postscript
format. It is shown below, as displayed by the Ghostscript viewer,
and may be converted to GIF through the <a href="S134.htm">Convert
Postscript</a> menu tab.</p>
