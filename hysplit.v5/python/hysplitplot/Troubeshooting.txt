1. Segmentation fault

When Shapely 1.6.4.post2 is used with Cartopy 1.17.0, a segmentation fault occurs.
Rolling back Shapely to 1.6.4.post1 resolves the issue.

Cartopy 1.17.0 and Shapely 1.6.4.post2 are using different versions of the GEOS
dynamic library, which seems to cause the segmentation fault.
