-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Installing Anaconda 3 on Windows 10

- Point your web browser to https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#windows.
- Download a Python 3.7 graphical installer.
  Use a 64-bit installer if you are running 64-bit Windows 10.
  Version 2019.10 is the latest version available at the time of writing.
  From this point and on, it is assumed that a 64-bit Windows operating
  system is used.
- Run the installer as described at https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/.
- At “Select Installation Type,” ensure the “Just Me” option is selected.
- At other screens, accept the default settings.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Installing python packages

- From the Windows Start menu, go to "Anaconda3 (64-bit)" and click
  "Anaconda Prompt (anaconda3)." This will open an anaconda prompt.
- Using the anaconda prompt, change directory to the python directory
  of your hysplit installation. For example, if hysplit is installed
  at C:\hysplit, the python directory would be C:\hysplit\python.
- Type install_win10 on the anaconda prompt and hit the enter key.
  The hysplit anaconda environment will be created and all required
  packages will be installed.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Unit testing hysplitdata

- Running unit tests is optional. It is a good idea to run unit tests and
  check their outputs to ensure packages are installed correctly.
- Assuming the anaconda prompt from the previous step is still open,
  change directory to hysplitdata\tests.
- If the terminal prompt does not start with "(hysplit)", the hysplit
  anaconda environment needs to be activated. Activate it by running
  the "conda activate hysplit" command.
- Enter pytest on the anaconda terminal and push the enter key.
- All unit tests should pass.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Unit testing hysplitplot

- Running unit tests is optional. Running unit tests and checking their
  outputs are encouraged to ensure all required packages are installed.
- Assuming the anaconda prompt from the previous step is still open,
  change directory to hysplitplot\tests from the python folder.
- If the terminal prompt does not start with "(hysplit)", the hysplit
  anaconda environment needs to be activated. Activate it by running
  the "conda activate hysplit" command.
- Run pytest on the anaconda terminal.
- All unit tests should pass.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Setting up Hysplit GUI to use python graphics

- For this section, you would need to know where the hysplit anaconda
  environment is installed. Open an anaconda3 prompt as described in Section 2.
  Run "conda info -e" and look for the line starting with hysplit. If anaconda
  is installed using default installation settings, the environment would be
  located at C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Local\Continuum\anaconda3\envs\hysplit
  where YOUR_USERNAME is your Widows username.
- Locate the "Run Hysplit" icon on your Windows Desktop.
- Double click the icon to start the Hysplit graphical user interface (GUI).
- Click the Menu button at the bottom.
- At the "Menus of Hysplit" window, locate the Advanced button on the top right.
- Click the Advanced / Configuration Setup / Set Directories.
- Enter the path to the hysplit environment at "Anaconda3 environment path."
- Click the "Update file: default_exec."

6. Rebooting your computer if necessary

It is reported that, after the python graphics for Hysplit is installed,
Hysplit GUI hangs up when a plot is created in the pdf or the Postscript
format using the python graphics. Rebooting your computer should resolve
the issue.
