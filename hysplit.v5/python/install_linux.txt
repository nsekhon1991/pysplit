-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Installing Anaconda 3 on Linux

- Point your web browser to https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#linux/.
- Download a Python 3.7 installer for Linux.
  Use a 64-bit installer if you are running 64-bit Linux.
  Version 2019.10 is the latest version available at the time of writing.
  From this point and on, it is assumed that a 64-bit Linux operating
  system is used.
- Run the installer as described at https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/.
  For simplicity, it is assumed that anaconda is installed in your home
  directory, namely, $HOME/anaconda3.
- If you are using FastX, it is necessary to disable the dbus-daemon and
  the dbus-launch commands in the $HOME/anaconda3/bin/ directory. Rename
  them to dbus-daemon.orig and dbus-launch.orig, respectively.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Installing python packages

- Open a Linux terminal.
- Change directory to the python directory of your hysplit installation.
  For example, if hysplit is installed at $HOME/hysplit, the python
  directory would be $HOME/hysplit/python.
- Type ./install_linux.sh on the terminal and hit the enter key.
  The hysplit anaconda environment will be created and all required
  packages will be installed.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Unit testing hysplitdata

- Running unit tests is optional. It is a good idea to run unit tests and
  check their outputs to ensure packages are installed correctly.
- Assuming the terminal prompt from the previous step is still open,
  change directory to hysplitdata/tests.
- If the terminal prompt does not start with "(hysplit)", the hysplit
  anaconda environment needs to be activated. Activate it by running
  the "conda activate hysplit" command.
- Enter pytest on the anaconda terminal and push the enter key.
- All unit tests should pass.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Unit testing hysplitplot

- Running unit tests is optional. Running unit tests and checking their
  outputs are encouraged to ensure all required packages are installed.
- Assuming the anaconda prompt from the previous step is still open,
  change directory to hysplitplot/tests from the python folder.
- If the terminal prompt does not start with "(hysplit)", the hysplit
  anaconda environment needs to be activated. Activate it by running
  the "conda activate hysplit" command.
- Run pytest on the terminal.
- All unit tests should pass.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Setting up Hysplit GUI to use python graphics

- For this section, you would need to know where the hysplit anaconda
  environment is installed. Open an anaconda3 prompt as described in Section 2.
  Run "conda info -e" and look for the line starting with hysplit. If anaconda
  is installed using default installation settings, the environment would be
  located at $HOME/anaconda3/envs/hysplit where $HOME is your home directory.
- Go to the work directory of your hysplit installation.
- Run ../guicode/hysplit.tcl.
- Click the Menu button at the bottom.
- At the "Menus of Hysplit" window, locate the Advanced button on the top right.
- Click buttons Advanced / Configuration Setup / Set Directories.
- Enter the path to the hysplit environment at "Anaconda3 environment path."
- Click the "Update file: default_exec."
