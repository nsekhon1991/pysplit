HYSPLIT AUTO CONFIGURATION DIRECTORY

The HYSPLIT "QWIK" Graphical User Interface (GUI) is designed to quickly configure, 
run, and display dispersion simulations. The options are limited to the ones most
relevant for shorter-range emergency response applications using the current forecast
meteorological data from NCEP's 12 km resolution NAM (WRF-NMM). The QWIK version is
only supplied for special applications and normally this directory would be empty.
