This directory should be the working directory or "Start In" directory
for the Hysplit GUI.  The interface is started as a shortcut from the 
desktop or start programs menu, the target of which is the upper level
tcl source code script /guicode/hysplit.tcl.  Tcl/Tk must be 
installed prior to running the GUI.  See the README file in /guicode 
for more information. In addition, if the convert to Postscript option 
is selected and the resulting files are to be viewed, then a Postscript
viewer should be installed (e.g. www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost)

The "plants.txt" file contains a sample listing of starting locations.
This file can be opened in the GUI to select from a list of previously
deterimined starting locations.  This file can be customized.

This directory contains the sample meteorological data file, 
oct1618.BIN, over the US for October 16th/00 through the 18th/00 of 
1995.  The file is used for calculations shown in the User's Guide. 
Other, current or archive, meteorological data can be obtained from 
the ARL/READY web site: http://www.arl.noaa.gov/ready.html
