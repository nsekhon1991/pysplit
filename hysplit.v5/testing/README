________________________________________________________________________________

On the development side, the testing directory is used to insure that as new code
changes are introduced, various model configuration simulations still produce results.
The xrun script is executed, which runs a series of simulations in sequence as 
configured in the various CONTROL and SETUP namelist files.  There is one output graphic
for each simulation (plot_???.ps) which are combined into a single Postscript file
(results.ps).  The individual graphical frames in this file should be identical or 
comparable to the graphics for the simulations run on our development PC as shown in the
the results.pdf file.

On the applications side, the xrun script can be used as a guidline in configuring
a variety of different simulations, some of which are not discussed in the user's guide.
The script also provides a template for automation and other customization scripting.
